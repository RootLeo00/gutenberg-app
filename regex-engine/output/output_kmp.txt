KING, LITT.D., F.S.A.Assistant Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the British MuseumProfessor of Assyrian and Babylonian Archæology inthe University of LondonWITH MAP, PLANS, AND ILLUSTRATIONSLONDON1915PREFACEIn the first volume of this work an account was given of the earlyraces of Babylonia from prehistoric times to the foundation of themonarchy. It closed at the point when the city of Babylon was aboutto secure the permanent leadership under her dynasty of West-Semitickings. The present volume describes the fortunes of Babylonia duringthe whole of the dynastic period, and it completes the history ofthe southern kingdom. Last autumn, in consequence of the war, itwas decided to postpone its publication; but, at the request of thepublishers, I have now finished it and seen it through the press. Ata time when British troops are in occupation of Southern Mesopotamia,the appearance of a work upon its earlier history may perhaps not beconsidered altogether inopportune.Thanks to recent excavation Babylon has ceased to be an abstraction,and we are now able to reconstitute the main features of one of themost famous cities of the ancient world. Unlike Ashur and Nineveh, thegreat capitals of Assyria, Babylon survived with but little changeunder the Achæmenian kings of Persia, and from the time of Herodotusonward we possess accounts of her magnificence, which recent researchhas in great part substantiated. It is true that we must modify thedescription Herodotus has left us of her size, but on all other pointsthe accuracy of his information is confirmed. The Lion Frieze of theCitadel and the enamelled beasts of the Ishtar Gate enable us tounderstand something of the spell she cast. It is claimed that thesite has been identified of her most famous building, the HangingGardens of the royal palace; and, if that should prove to be the case,they can hardly be said to have justified their reputation. Far moreimpressive is the Tower of Babel with its huge Peribolos, enclosingwhat has been aptly described as the Vatican of Babylon.The majority of the buildings uncovered date from the Neo-Babylonianperiod, but they may be regarded as typical of Babylonian civilizationas a whole. For temples were rebuilt again and again on the old lines,and religious conservatism retained the mud-brick walls and primitivedecoration of earlier periods. Even Nabopolassar's royal palace musthave borne a close resemblance to that of Hammurabi; and the streetnetwork of the city appears to have descended without much change fromthe time of the First Dynasty. The system which Hammurabi introducedinto the legislation of his country may perhaps have been reflected inthe earliest attempt at town-planning on a scientific basis. The moststriking fact about Babylon's history is the continuity of her cultureduring the whole of the dynastic period. The principal modificationwhich took place was in the system of land-tenure, the primitivecustom of tribal or collective proprietorship giving place to privateownership under the policy of purchase and annexation deliberatelypursued by the West-Semitic and Kassite conquerors. A parallel tothe earlier system and its long survival may be seen in the villagecommunities of India at the present day.In contrast to that of Assyria, the history of Babylon is moreconcerned with the development and spread of a civilization than withthe military achievements of a race. Her greatest period of power wasunder her first line of kings; and in after ages her foreign policy wasdictated solely by her commercial needs. The letters from Boghaz Keui,like those from Tell el-Amarna, suggest that, in keeping her tradeconnexions open, she relied upon diplomacy in preference to force.That she could fight at need is proved by her long struggle with thenorthern kingdom, but in the later period her troops were never a matchfor the trained legions of Assyria. It is possible that Nabopolassarand his son owed their empire in great measure to the protecting arm ofMedia; and Nebuchadnezzar's success at Carchemish does not prove thatthe Babylonian character had suddenly changed. A recently recoveredletter throws light on the unsatisfactory state of at least one sectionof the army during Nebuchadnezzar's later years, and incidentally itsuggests that Gobryas, who facilitated the Persian occupation, may beidentified with a Babylonian general of that name. With the fall ofMedia, he may perhaps have despaired of any successful opposition onhis country's part.Babylon's great wealth, due to her soil and semi-tropical climate,enabled her to survive successive foreign dominations and to impose hercivilization on her conquerors. Her caravans carried that civilizationfar afield, and one of the most fascinating problems of her historyis to trace the effect of such intercourse in the literary remains ofother nations. Much recent research has been devoted to this subject,and the great value of its results has given rise in some quarters tothe view that the religious development of Western Asia, and in a minordegree of Europe, was dominated by the influence of Babylon. The theorywhich underlies such speculation assumes a reading of the country'shistory which cannot be ignored. In the concluding chapter an estimatehas been attempted of the extent to which the assumption is in harmonywith historical research.The delay in the publication of this volume has rendered it possibleto incorporate recent discoveries, some of which have not as yetappeared in print. Professor A. T. Clay has been fortunate enoughto acquire for the Yale University Collection a complete list ofthe early kings of Larsa, in addition to other documents with animportant bearing on the history of Babylon. He is at present preparingthe texts for publication, and has meanwhile very kindly sent metranscripts of the pertinent material with full permission to make useof them. The information afforded as to the overlapping of additionaldynasties with the First Dynasty of Babylon has thrown new light onthe circumstances which led to the rise of Babylon to power. But theseand other recent discoveries, in their general effect, do not involveany drastic changes in the chronological scheme as a whole. They leadrather to local rearrangements, which to a great extent counterbalanceone another. Under Babylon's later dynasties her history and that ofAssyria are so closely inter-related that it is difficult to isolatethe southern kingdom. An attempt has been made to indicate broadlythe chief phases of the conflict, and the manner in which Babylonianinterests alone were affected. In order to avoid needless repetition, afuller treatment of the period is postponed to the third volume of thiswork. A combined account will then also be given of the literature andcivilization of both countries.I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to Monsieur F.Thureau-Dangin, Conservateur-adjoint of the Museums of the Louvre, forallowing me last spring to study unpublished historical material in hischarge. The information he placed at my disposal I found most usefulduring subsequent work in the Ottoman Museum at Constantinople shortlybefore the war. Reference has already been made to my indebtednessto Professor Clay, who has furnished me from time to time with otherunpublished material, for which detailed acknowledgment is made in thecourse of this work. With Professor C. F. Burney I have discussed manyof the problems connected with the influence of Babylon upon Hebrewliterature; and I am indebted to Professor A. C. Headlam for permissionto reprint portions of an article on that subject, which I contributedin 1912 to the _Church Quarterly Review._To Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge my thanks are due, as he suggested that Ishould write these histories, and he has given me the benefit of hisadvice. To him, as to Sir Frederic Kenyon and Mr. D. G. Hogarth, Iam indebted for permission to make use of illustrations, which haveappeared in official publications of the British Museum. My thanksare also due to Monsieur Ernest Leroux of Paris for allowing me toreproduce some of the plates from the "Mémoires de la Délégation enPerse," published by him under the editorship of Monsieur J. de Morgan;and to the Council and Secretary of the Society of Biblical Archæologyfor the loan of a block employed to illustrate a paper I contributed totheir Proceedings. The greater number of the plates illustrating theexcavations are from photographs taken on the spot; and the plans anddrawings figured in the text are the work of Mr. E. J. Lambert and Mr.C. O. Waterhouse, who have spared no pains to ensure their accuracy.The designs upon the cover of this volume represent the two mostprominent figures in Babylonian tradition. In the panel on the face ofthe cover the national hero Gilgamesh is portrayed, whose epic reflectsthe Babylonian heroic ideal. The panel on the back of the bindingcontains a figure of Marduk, the city-god of Babylon, grasping in hisright hand the flaming sword with which he severed the dragon of chaos.L. W.

Map of Babylonia, Assyria and Mesopotamia. Inset: Map    of Western AsiaA HISTORY OF BABYLONCHAPTER IINTRODUCTORY: BABYLON'S PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF ANTIQUITYThe name of Babylon suggests one of the great centres from whichcivilization radiated to other peoples of the ancient world. And itis true that from the second millennium onwards we have evidence ofthe gradual spread of Babylonian culture throughout the greater partof Western Asia. Before the close of the fifteenth century, to cite asingle example of such influence, we find that Babylonian had becomethe language of Eastern diplomacy. It is not surprising perhaps thatthe Egyptian king should have adopted the Babylonian tongue and methodof writing for his correspondence with rulers of Babylon itself orof Assyria. But it is remarkable that he should employ this foreignscript and language for sending orders to the governors of his Syrianand Palestinian dependencies, and that such Canaanite officialsshould use the same medium for the reports they despatched to theirEgyptian master. In the same period we find the Aryan rulers ofMitanni, in Northern Mesopotamia, writing in cuneiform the language oftheir adopted country. A few decades later the Hittites of Anatolia,discarding their old and clumsy system of hieroglyphs except formonumental purposes, borrow the same character for their own speech,while their treaties with Egypt are drawn up in Babylonian. In theninth century the powerful race of the Urartians, settled in themountains of Armenia around the shores of Lake Van, adopt as theirnational script the writing of Assyria, which in turn had been derivedfrom Babylon. Elam, Babylon's nearest foreign neighbour, at a veryearly period had, like the Hittites of a later age, substituted fortheir rude hieroglyphs the language and older characters of Babylon,and later on they evolved from the same writing a character of theirown. Finally, coming down to the sixth century, we find the Achæmeniankings inventing a cuneiform sign-list to express the Old Persianlanguage, in order that their own speech might be represented in royalproclamations and memorials beside those of their subject provinces ofBabylon and Susiania.These illustrations of Babylonian influence on foreign races areconfined to one department of culture only, the language and the systemof writing. But they have a very much wider implication. For whena foreign language is used and written, a certain knowledge of itsliterature must be presupposed. And since all early literatures werelargely religious in character, the study of the language carries withit some acquaintance with the legends, mythology and religious beliefsof the race from whom it was borrowed. Thus, even if we leave out ofaccount the obvious effects of commercial intercourse, the single groupof examples quoted necessarily implies a strong cultural influence oncontemporary races.It may thus appear a paradox to assert that the civilization, withwhich the name of Babylon is associated, was not Babylonian. But it isa fact that for more than a thousand years before the appearance ofthat city as a great centre of culture, the civilization it handed onto others had acquired in all essentials its later type. In artisticexcellence, indeed, a standard had been already reached, which, so farfrom being surpassed, was never afterwards attained in Mesopotamia.And although the Babylonian may justly be credited with greater systemin his legislation, with an extended literature, and perhaps also withan increased luxury of ritual, his efforts were entirely controlledby earlier models. If we except the spheres of poetry and ethics, theSemite in Babylon, as elsewhere, proved himself a clever adapter,not a creator. He was the prophet of Sumerian culture and merelyperpetuated the achievements of the race whom he displaced politicallyand absorbed. It is therefore the more remarkable that his particularcity should have seen but little of the process by which that culturehad been gradually evolved. During those eventful centuries Babylon hadbeen but little more than a provincial town. Yet it was reserved forthis obscure and unimportant city to absorb within herself the resultsof that long process, and to appear to later ages as the originalsource of the culture she enjoyed. Before tracing her politicalfortunes in detail it will be well to consider briefly the causes whichcontributed to her retention of the place she so suddenly secured forherself.The fact that under her West-Semitic kings Babylon should have takenrank as the capital city does not in itself account for her permanentenjoyment of that position. The earlier history of the lands ofSumer and Akkad abounds with similar examples of the sudden rise ofcities, followed, after an interval of power, by their equally suddenrelapse into comparative obscurity. The political centre of gravitywas continually shifting from one town to another, and the problem wehave to solve is why, having come to rest in Babylon, it should haveremained there. To the Western Semites themselves, after a politicalexistence of three centuries, it must have seemed that their city wasabout to share the fate of her numerous predecessors. When the Hittiteraiders captured and sacked Babylon and carried off her patron deities,events must have appeared to be taking their normal course. After thecountry, with her abounding fertility, had been given time to recoverfrom her temporary depression, she might have been expected to emergeonce more, according to precedent, under the aegis of some othercity. Yet it was within the ancient walls of Babylon that the Kassiteconquerors established their headquarters; and it was to Babylon, longrebuilt and once more powerful, that the Pharaohs of the eighteenthDynasty and the Hittite kings of Cappadocia addressed their diplomaticcorrespondence. During Assyria's long struggle with the southernkingdom Babylon was always the protagonist, and no raid by Aramean orChaldean tribes ever succeeded in ousting her from that position. Atthe height of Assyrian power she continued to be the chief check uponthat empire's expansion, and the vacillating policy of the Sargonidsin their treatment of the city sufficiently testifies to the dominant_rôle_ she continued to play in politics. And when Nineveh had fallen,it was Babylon that took her place in a great part of Western Asia.This continued pre-eminence of a single city is in striking contrastto the ephemeral authority of earlier capitals, and it can only beexplained by some radical change in the general conditions of thecountry. One fact stands out clearly: Babylon's geographical positionmust have endowed her during this period with a strategical andcommercial importance which enabled her to survive the rudest shocksto her material prosperity. A glance at the map will show that thecity lay in the north of Babylonia, just below the confluence of thetwo great rivers in their lower course. Built originally on the leftbank of the Euphrates, she was protected by its stream from any suddenincursion of the desert tribes. At the same time she was in immediatecontact with the broad expanse of alluvial plain to the south-east,intersected by its network of canals.But the real strength of her position lay in her near neighbourhoodto the transcontinental routes of traffic. When approaching Baghdadfrom the north the Mesopotamian plain contracts to a width of somethirty-five miles, and, although it has already begun to expand againin the latitude of Babylon, that city was well within touch of bothrivers. She consequently lay at the meeting-point of two great avenuesof commerce. The Euphrates route linked Babylonia with Northern Syriaand the Mediterranean, and was her natural line of contact with Egypt;it also connected her with Cappadocia, by way of the Cilician Gatesthrough the Taurus, along the track of the later Royal Road.[1] Farthernorth the trunk-route through Anatolia from the west, reinforced bytributary routes from the Black Sea, turns at Sivas on the Upper Halys,and after crossing the Euphrates in the mountains, first strikes theTigris at Diarbekr; then leaving that river for the easier plain, itrejoins the stream in the neighbourhood of Nineveh and so advancessouthward to Susa or to Babylon. A third great route that Babyloncontrolled was that to the east through the Gates of Zagros, theeasiest point of penetration to the Iranian plateau and the naturaloutlet of commerce from Northern Elam.[2] Babylon thus lay across thestream of the nations' traffic, and in the direct path of any invaderadvancing upon the southern plains.That she owed her importance to her strategic position, and not to anyparticular virtue on the part of her inhabitants, will be apparent fromthe later history of the country. It has indeed been pointed out thatthe geographical conditions render necessary the existence of a greaturban centre near the confluence of the Mesopotamian rivers.[3] Andthis fact is amply attested by the relative positions of the capitalcities, which succeeded one another in that region after the supremacyhad passed from Babylon. Seleucia, Ctesiphon and Baghdad are allclustered in the narrow neck of the Mesopotamian plain, and for onlyone short period, when normal conditions were suspended, has the centreof government been transferred to any southern city.[4] The sole changehas consisted in the permanent selection of the Tigris for the site ofeach new capital, with a decided tendency to remove it to the left oreastern bank.[5] That the Euphrates should have given place in this wayto her sister river was natural enough in view of the latter's deeperchannel and better water way, which gained in significance as soon asthe possibility of maritime communication was contemplated.Throughout the whole period of Babylon's supremacy the Persian Gulf,so far from being a channel of international commerce, was as greata barrier as any mountain range. Doubtless a certain amount of localcoasting traffic was always carried on, and the heavy blocks of dioritewhich were brought to Babylonia from Magan by the early Akkadian kingNarâm-Sin, and at a rather later period by Gudea of Lagash,[6] musthave been transported by water rather than over land. Tradition, too,ascribed the conquest of the island of Dilmun, the modern Bahrein,to Sargon of Akkad; but that marked the extreme limit of Babylonianpenetration southwards, and the conquest must have been little morethan a temporary occupation following a series of raids down theArabian coast. The fact that two thousand years later Sargon ofAssyria, when recording his receipt of tribute from Upêri of Dilmun,should have been so far out in his estimate of its distance from theBabylonian coast-line,[7] is an indication of the continued disuse ofthe waters of the gulf as a means of communication. On this suppositionwe may readily understand the difficulties encountered by Sennacheribwhen transporting his army across the head of the gulf against certaincoast-towns of Elam, and the necessity, to which he was put, ofbuilding special ships for the purpose.There is evidence that in the Neo-Babylonian period the possibilitiesof transport by way of the gulf had already begun to attract attention,and Nebuchadnezzar II. is said to have attempted to build harboursin the swamp at the mouths of the delta.[8] But his object must havebeen confined to encouraging coastal trade, for the sea-route betweenthe Persian Gulf and India was certainly not in use before the fifthcentury, and in all probability was inaugurated by Alexander. Accordingto Herodotus[9] it had been opened by Darius after the return of theGreek Scylax of Caryanda from his journey to India, undertaken as oneof the surveying expeditions on the basis of which Darius foundedthe assessment of his new satrapies. But, although there is no needto doubt the historical character of that voyage, there is littleto suggest that Scylax coasted round, or even entered, the PersianGulf.[10] Moreover, it is clear that, while Babylon's internationaltrade received a great impetus under the efficient organization ofthe Persian Empire, it was the overland routes which benefited. Theoutcrops of rock, or cataracts, which blocked the Tigris for vesselsof deeper draft, were not removed until Alexander levelled them; andthe problem of Babylon's sea-traffic, to which he devoted the closingmonths of his life, was undoubtedly one of the factors which, havingnow come into prominence for the first time, influenced Seleucus inselecting a site on the Tigris for his new capital.[11]But that was not the only cause of Babylon's deposition. For afterher capture by Cyrus, new forces came into play which favoured atransference of the capital eastward. During the earlier periods of herhistory Babylon's chief rival and most persistent enemy had lain uponher eastern frontier. To the early Sumerian rulers of city-states Elamhad been "the mountain that strikes terror,"[12] and during subsequentperiods the cities of Sumer and Akkad could never be sure of immunityfrom invasion in that quarter. We shall see that in Elam the WesternSemites of Babylon found the chief obstacle to the southward extensionof their authority, and that in later periods any symptom of internalweakness or dissension was the signal for renewed attack. It is truethat the Assyrian danger drew these ancient foes together for a time,but even the sack of Susa by Ashur-bani-pal did not put an end to theircommercial rivalry.During all this period there was small temptation to transfer thecapital to any point within easier striking distance of so powerful aneighbour; and with the principal passes for eastward traffic underforeign control, it was natural that the Euphrates route to NorthernMesopotamia and the Mediterranean coast should continue to be thechief outlet for Babylonian commerce. But on the incorporation of thecountry within the Persian empire all danger of interference with hereastern trade was removed; and it is a testimony to the part Babylonhad already played in history that she continued to be the capitalcity of Asia for more than two centuries. Cyrus, like Alexander,entered the city as a conqueror, but each was welcomed by the peopleand their priests as the restorer of ancient rights and privileges.Policy would thus have been against any attempt to introduce radicalinnovations. The prestige the city enjoyed and the grandeur of itstemples and palaces doubtless also weighed with the Achæmenian kings intheir choice of Babylon for their official residence, except during thesummer months. Then they withdrew to the cooler climate of Persepolisor Ecbatana, and during the early spring, too, they might transfer thecourt to Susa; but they continued to recognize Babylon as their truecapital. In fact, the city only lost its importance when the centre ofgovernment was removed to Seleucia in its own immediate neighbourhood.Then, at first possibly under compulsion, and afterwards of their ownfreewill, the commercial classes followed their rulers to the west bankof the Tigris; and Babylon suffered in proportion. In the swift rise ofSeleucia in response to official orders, we may see clear proof thatthe older city's influence had been founded upon natural conditions,which were shared in an equal, and now in even a greater degree, by thesite of the new capital.[Illustration: FIG. 1.DIAGRAM TO ILLUSTRATE THE POLITICAL CENTRE OF GRAVITY IN BABYLONIA.The circle marks the limits within which the capital shifted from theperiod of the First Dynasty onwards. It was only under the abnormalconditions produced by the Moslem conquest that Kûfa and Basra becamefor five generations the twin capitals of 'Irâk; this interval presentsa parallel to the earlier period before the rise of Babylon.]The secret of Babylon's greatness is further illustrated by stilllater events in the valley of the Euphrates and the Tigris. The riseof Ctesiphon on the left bank of the river was a further result ofthe eastward trend of commerce. But it lay immediately oppositeSeleucia, and marked no fresh shifting of the centre of gravity. Oflittle importance under the Seleucid rulers, it became the chief cityof the Arsacidæ, and, after the Parthian Empire had been conquered byArdashir I., it continued to be the principal city of the province andbecame the winter residence of the Sassanian kings. When in 636 A.D.the Moslem invaders defeated the Persians near the ruins of Babylonand in the following year captured Ctesiphon, they found that cityand Seleucia to which they gave the joint name of Al-Madâin, or "thecities," still retaining the importance their site had acquired in thethird century B.C. Then follows a period of a hundred and twenty-fiveyears which is peculiarly instructive for comparison with the earlierepochs of Babylonian history.The last of the great Semitic migrations from Arabia had resultedin the conquests of Islam, when, after the death of Mohammed, theArab armies poured into Western Asia in their efforts to convert theworld to their faith. The course of the movement, and its effect uponestablished civilizations which were overthrown, may be traced in thefull light of history; and we find in the valley of the Tigris andEuphrates a resultant economic condition which forms a close parallelto that of the age before the rise of Babylon. The military occupationof Mesopotamia by the Arabs closed for a time the great avenues oftranscontinental commerce; and, as a result, the political control ofthe country ceased to be exercised from the capital of the Sassaniankings and was distributed over more than one area. New towns spranginto being around the permanent camps of the Arab armies. Following onthe conquest of Mesopotamia, the city of Basra was built on the Shattel-'Arab in the extreme south of the country, while in the same year,638 A.D., Kûfa was founded more to the north-west on the desert side ofthe Euphrates. A third great town, Wâsit, was added sixty-five yearslater, and this arose in the centre of the country on both banks ofthe Tigris, whose waters were then passing along the present bed ofthe Shatt el-Hai. It is true that Madâin retained a measure of localimportance, but during the Omayyad Caliphate Kûfa and Basra were thetwin capitals of 'Irâk.[13]Thus the slackening of international connections led at once to adistribution of authority between a north and a south Babyloniansite. It is true that both capitals were under the same politicalcontrol, but from the economic standpoint we are forcibly reminded ofthe era of city-states in Sumer and Akkad. Then, too, there was noexternal factor to retain the centre of gravity in the north; andErech more than once secured the hegemony, while the most stable ofthe shifting dynasties was the latest of the southern city of Ur. Therise of Babylon as the sole and permanent capital of Sumer and Akkadmay be traced, as we shall note, to increased relations with NorthernSyria, which followed the establishment of her dynasty of West-Semitickings.[14] And again we may see history repeating herself, when Moslemauthority is removed to Baghdad at the close of the first phase inthe Arab occupation of Mesopotamia. For on the fall of the Omayyaddynasty and the transference of the Abbasid capital from Damascus tothe east, commercial intercourse with Syria and the west was restoredto its old footing. Basra and Kûfa at once failed to respond to thechanged conditions, and a new administrative centre was required. Itis significant that Baghdad should have been built a few miles aboveCtesiphon, within the small circle of the older capitals;[15] andthat, with the exception of a single short period,[16] she should haveremained the capital city of 'Irâk. Thus the history of Mesopotamiaunder the Caliphate is instructive for the study of the closelyparallel conditions which enabled Babylon at a far earlier period tosecure the hegemony in Babylonia and afterwards to retain it.From this brief survey of events it will have been noted that Babylon'ssupremacy falls in the middle period of her country's history, duringwhich she distributed a civilization in the origin of which she playedno part. When she passed, the culture she had handed on passed withher, though on Mesopotamian soil its decay was gradual. But she hadalready delivered her message, and it has left its mark on the remainsof other races of antiquity which have come down to us. We shall seethat it was in three main periods that her influence made itself feltin any marked degree beyond the limits of the home-land. The earliestof these periods of external contact was that of her First Dynasty ofWest-Semitic rulers, though the most striking evidence of its effect isonly forthcoming after some centuries had passed. In the second periodthe process was indirect, her culture being carried north and westby the expansion of Assyria. The last of the three epochs coincideswith the rule of the Neo-Babylonian kings, when, thanks to her naturalresources, the country not only regained her independence, but for ashort time established an empire which far eclipsed her earlier effort.And in spite of her speedy return, under Persian rule, to the positionof a subject province, her foreign influence may be regarded asoperative, it is true in diminishing intensity, well into the Hellenicperiod.The concluding chapter will deal in some detail with certainfeatures of Babylonian civilization, and with the extent to whichit may have moulded the cultural development of other races. Inthe latter connexion a series of claims has been put forward whichcannot be ignored in any treatment of the nation's history. Some ofthe most interesting contributions that have recently been made toAssyriologieal study undoubtedly concern the influence of ideas, whichearlier research had already shown to be of Babylonian origin. Withinrecent years a school has arisen in Germany which emphasizes the partplayed by Babylon in the religious development of Western Asia, and,in a minor degree, of Europe. The evidence on which reliance has beenplaced to prove the spread of Babylonian thought throughout the ancientworld has been furnished mainly by Israel and Greece; and it is claimedthat many features both in Hebrew religion and in Greek mythology canonly be rightly studied in the light thrown upon them by Babylonianparallels from which they were ultimately derived. It will thereforebe necessary to examine briefly the theory which underlies most recentspeculation on this subject, and to ascertain, if possible, how far itmay be relied on to furnish results of permanent value.But it will be obvious that, if the theory is to be accepted in wholeor in part, it must be shown to rest upon a firm historical basis, andthat any inquiry into its credibility should be more fitly postponeduntil the history of the nation itself has been passed in review. Afterthe evidence of actual contact with other races has been establishedin detail, it will be possible to form a more confident judgmentupon questions which depend for their solution solely on a balancingof probabilities. The estimate of Babylon's foreign influence hastherefore been postponed to the closing chapter of the volume. Butbefore considering the historical sequence of her dynasties, and theperiods to which they may be assigned, it will be well to inquire whatrecent excavation has to tell us of the actual remains of the citywhich became the permanent capital of Babylonia.[Footnote 1: Cf. Hogarth, "The Nearer East," pp. 212 ff., and Ramsay,"The Historical Geography of Asia Minor," pp. 27 ff. Herodotus (V,52-54) describes the "Royal Road" of the Persian period as passingfrom Ephesus by the Cilician Gates to Susa, and it obtained its namefrom the fact that all government business of the Persian Court passedalong it; the distances, given by Herodotus in parasangs and stages,may well be derived from some official Persian document (cf. How andWells, "Commentary on Herodotus," II, p. 21). But it followed the trackof a still earlier Royal Road, by which Khatti, the capital of the oldHittite Empire, maintained its communications westward and with theEuphrates valley.][Footnote 2: At the present day this forms the great trunk-road acrossthe highlands of Persia, by way of Kirmanshah; and, since the Moslemconquest, it has been the chief overland route from the farther Eastfor all those making the pilgrimage to Mecca.][Footnote 3: Cf. Hogarth, _op. cit.,_ p. 200 f.][Footnote 4: See below, pp. 9 ff.][Footnote 5: It is not improbable that the transference from one bankto the other was dictated by the relations of the ruling empire withPersia and the West.][Footnote 6: See "Sumer and Akkad," p. 242.][Footnote 7: Cf.

The fact that from time to timeother cities of Akkad had secured the leadership, suggests that theforces which eventually placed Babylon at the head of the country werealready beginning to be felt. They were doubtless checked in no smalldegree by the absence of an internal administration of any lastingstability during the acute racial conflict which characterized theperiod.][Footnote 15: The city was founded by the second Abbasid Caliph in 762A.D.][Footnote 16: For a period of fifty-six years (336-392 A.D.) theCaliphate was removed to Sâmarrâ.

Le Strange, _op. cit.,_ p. 32.]CHAPTER IITHE CITY OF BABYLON AND ITS REMAINS: A DISCUSSION OF THE RECENTEXCAVATIONSThe actual site of Babylon was never lost in popular tradition. Inspite of the total disappearance of the city, which followed itsgradual decay under Seleucid and Parthian rule, its ancient famesufficed to keep it in continual remembrance. The old Semitic nameBâb-ilî, "the Gate of the Gods," lingered on about the site, and underthe form Babil is still the local designation for the most northerly ofthe city-mounds. Tradition, too, never ceased to connect the exposedbrickwork of Nebuchadnezzar's main citadel and palace with his name.Ḳaṣr, the Arab name for the chief palace-mound and citadel of Babylon,means "palace" or "castle," and when in the twelfth century Benjaminof Tudela visited Baghdad, the Jews of that city told him that inthe neighbouring ruins, near Hilla, the traveller might still beholdNebuchadnezzar's palace beside the fiery furnace into which Hananiah,Mishael and Azariah had been thrown. It does not seem that thisadventurous rabbi actually visited the site,[1] though it is unlikelythat he was deterred by fear of the serpents and scorpions with which,his informants said, the ruins were infested.In the sixteenth century an English merchant traveller, John Eldred,made three voyages to "New Babylon," as he calls Baghdad, journeyingfrom Aleppo down the Euphrates. On the last occasion, after describinghis landing at Faluja, and how he secured a hundred asses for lackof camels to carry his goods to Baghdad, he tells us that "in thisplace which we crossed over stood the olde mightie citie of Babylon,many olde ruines whereof are easilie to be scene by daylight, whichI, John Eldred, have often behelde at my goode leisure having madethree voyages between the New Citie of Babylon and Aleppo over thisdesert."[2] But it would seem probable from his further descriptionthat "the olde tower of Babell," which he visited "sundry times," wasreally the ruin of 'Akarkûf, which he would have passed on his way toBaghdad. Benjamin of Tudela, on the other hand, had taken Birs-Nimrûdfor the Tower of Babel,[3] and had noted how the ruins of the streetsof Babylon still extend for thirty miles. In fact, it was natural thatseveral of the early travellers should have regarded the whole complexof ruins, which they saw still standing along their road to Baghdad,as parts of the ancient city; and it is not surprising that some ofthe earlier excavators should have fallen under a similar illusion sofar as the area between Bâbil and El-Birs is concerned.[4] The famousdescription of Herodotus, and the accounts other classical writershave left us of the city's size, tended to foster this conviction;and, although the centre of Babylon was identified correctly enough,the size of the city's area was greatly exaggerated. Babylon had casther spell upon mankind, and it has taken sixteen years of patient andcontinuous excavation to undermine that stubborn belief. But in theprocess of shrinkage, and as accurate knowledge has gradually givenplace to conjecture, the old spell has reappeared unchanged. It may beworth while to examine in some detail the results of recent work uponthe site, and note to what extent the city's remains have thrown lightupon its history while leaving some problems still unsolved.[Illustration: FIG. 2.MAP OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF BABYLON AND BIRS-NIMRÛD.A: The mound Bâbil.

In 1887, and againafter a lapse of ten years, Dr. Robert Koldewey visited the site ofBabylon and picked up fragments of enamelled bricks on the east sideof the Ḳaṣr. On the latter occasion he sent some of them to Berlin,and Dr. Richard Schöne, at that time Director of the Royal Museums,recognized their artistic and archæological interest. Thus it was withthe hope of making speedy and startling discoveries that the GermanOriental Society began work upon the site at the end of March in theyear 1899; and it is the more to the credit of the excavators thatthey have not allowed any difficulties or disappointments to curtailand bring to a premature close the steady progress of their research.The extent of ground covered by the remains of the ancient city, andthe great accumulation of _débris_ over some of the principal buildingsrendered the work more arduous than was anticipated, and consequentlythe publication of results has been delayed. It is true that, from thevery beginning of operations, the expert has been kept informed ofthe general progress of the digging by means of letters and reportsdistributed to its subscribers every few months by the society.[9] Butit was only in 1911, after twelve years of uninterrupted digging, thatthe first instalment was issued of the scientific publication. This wasconfined to the temples of the city, and for the first time placed thestudy of Babylonian religious architecture upon a scientific basis.[10]In the following year Dr. Koldewey, the director of the excavations,supplemented his first volume with a second, in which, under pressurefrom the society, he forestalled to some extent the future issues ofthe detailed account by summarizing the results obtained to date uponall sections of the site.[11] It has thus been rendered possible toform a connected idea of the remains of the ancient city, so far asthey have been recovered.In their work at Babylon the excavators have, of course, employedmodern methods, which differ considerably from those of the age whenLayard and Botta brought the winged bulls of Assyria to the BritishMuseum and to the Louvre. The extraordinary success which attendedthose earlier excavators has, indeed, never been surpassed. But itis now realized that only by minuteness of search and by carefulclassification of strata can the remains of the past be made toreveal in full their secrets. The fine museum specimen retains itsimportance; but it gains immensely in significance when it ceases to bean isolated product and takes its place in a detailed history of itsperiod.[Illustration: (i) The temple-tower of E-zida at Borsippa. (ii) TheLion of Babylon on the Ḳaṣr Mound]In order to grasp the character of the new evidence, and the methodsby which it has been obtained at Babylon, it is advisable to bear inmind some of the general characteristics of Babylonian architectureand the manner in which the art of building was influenced by thenatural conditions of the country. One important point to realize isthat the builders of all periods were on the defensive, and not solelyagainst human foes, for in that aspect they resembled other buildersof antiquity. The foe they most dreaded was Hood. Security againstflood conditioned the architect's ideal: he aimed solely at heightand mass. When a king built a palace for himself or a temple for hisgod, he did not consciously aim at making it graceful or beautiful.What he always boasts of having done is that he has made it "like amountain." He delighted to raise the level of his artificial mound orbuilding-platform, and the modern excavator owes much to this continualfilling in of the remains of earlier structures. The material at hisdisposal was also not without its influence in the production ofbuildings "like mountains," designed to escape the floods of the plain.The alluvial origin of the Babylonian soil deprived the inhabitantsof an important factor in the development of the builder's art:it produced for them no stone. But it supplied a very effectivebuilding-material in its place, a strongly adhesive clay. Throughouttheir whole history the Babylonian architects built in crude and inkiln-burnt brick. In the Neo-Babylonian period we find them makinginteresting technical experiments in this material, here a firstattempt to roof in a wide area with vaulting, elsewhere counteractingthe effects of settlement by a sort of expansion-joint. We shall see,too, that it was in this same medium that they attained to real beautyof design.Brick continued to be the main building-material in Assyria too, forthat country derived its culture from the lower Euphrates valley.[12]But in the north soft limestone quarries were accessible. So inAssyria they lined their mud-brick walls with slabs of limestone,carved in low relief and brightly coloured; and they set up huge stonecolossi to flank their palace entrances. This use of stone, both as awall-lining and in wall-foundations, constitutes the main differencebetween Babylonian and Assyrian architectural design. Incidentallyit explains how the earlier excavators were so much more successfulin Assyria than in Babylonia; for in both countries they drove theirtunnels and trenches into most of the larger mounds. They could tunnelwith perfect certainty when they had these stone linings of thewalls to guide them. But to follow out the ground-plan of a buildingconstructed only of unburnt brick, with mud or clay for mortar,necessitates a slower and more systematic process of examination.For unburnt brick becomes welded into a solid mass, scarcely to bedistinguished from the surrounding soil, and the lines of a building inthis material can only be recovered by complete excavation.An idea of the labour this sometimes entails may be gained from thework which preceded the identification of E-sagila, the great templeof Marduk, the city-god of Babylon. The temple lies at a depth ofno less than twenty-one metres below the upper level of the hill of_débris_; and portions of two of its massive mud-brick walls, togetherwith the neighbouring pavements, were uncovered by bodily removing thegreat depth of soil truck by truck. But here even German patience andthoroughness have been beaten, and tunnelling was eventually adoptedto establish the outer limits of the ground-plan, much of the interiorof which still remains unexplored.[13]The Babylon which has now been partially cleared, though in itscentral portion it reaches back to the First Dynasty and to theperiod of Hammurabi, is mainly that of the Neo-Babylonian empire,when Nebuchadnezzar II., and Nabonidus, the last native Babylonianking, raised their capital to a condition of magnificence it had notknown before. This city survived, with but little change, during thedomination of the Achæmenian kings of Persia, and from the time ofHerodotus onward Babylon was made famous throughout the ancient world.At that time Ashur and Nineveh, the great capitals of Assyria, hadceased to exist; but Babylon was still in her glory, and descriptionsof the city have come down to us in the works of classical writers.To fit this literary tradition to the actual remains of the city hasfurnished a number of fascinating problems. How, for example, are weto explain the puzzling discrepancy between the present position ofthe outer walls and the enormous estimate of the city's area given byHerodotus, or even that of Ctesias? For Herodotus himself appears tohave visited Babylon; and Ctesias was the physician of Artaxerxes II.Mnemon, who has left a memorial of his presence in a marble building onthe Ḳaṣr.Herodotus reckons that the walls of Babylon extended for four hundredand eighty stades, the area they enclosed forming an exact square,a hundred and twenty stades in length each way.[14] In other words,he would have us picture a city more than fifty-three miles incircumference. The estimate of Ctesias is not so large, his sideof sixty-five stades giving a circumference of rather over fortymiles.[15] Such figures, it has been suggested, are not in themselvesimpossible, Koldewey, for example, comparing the Great Wall of Chinawhich extends for more than fifteen hundred miles, and is thus abouttwenty-nine times as long as Herodotus's estimate for the wall ofBabylon.[16] But the latter was not simply a frontier-fortification.It was the enclosing wall of a city, and a more apposite comparison isthat of the walls of Nanking, the largest city-site in China, and thework of an empire even greater than Babylon.[17] The latter measureless than twenty-four miles in circuit, and the comparison does notencourage an acceptance of Herodotus's figures on grounds of generalprobability. It is true that Oppert accepted them, but he only foundthis possible by stretching his plan of the city to include the wholearea from Babil to Birs-Nimrûd,[18] and by seeing traces of the cityand its walls in every sort of intervening mound of whatever period.As a matter of fact part of the great wall, which surrounded the cityfrom the Neo-Babylonian period onward, has survived to the presentday, and may still be recognized in a low ridge of earth, or seriesof consecutive mounds,[19] which cross the plain for a considerabledistance to the south-east of Babil. The traveller from Baghdad, aftercrossing the present Nîl Canal by a bridge,[20] passes through a gap inthe north-eastern wall before he sees on his right the isolated moundof Bâbil with the extensive complex of the Ḳaṣr and its neighbour, Tell'Amrân-ibn-'Ali, stretching away in front and to his left.[21] Thewhole length of the city-wall, along the north-east side, may still betraced by the position of these low earthen mounds, and they prove thatthe city on this side measured not quite two and three-quarter milesin extent. The eastern angle of the wall is also preserved, and thesouth-east wall may be followed for another mile and a quarter as itdoubles back towards the Euphrates. These two walls, together with theEuphrates, enclose the only portion of the ancient city on which ruinsof any importance still exist. But, according to Herodotus and otherwriters, the city was enclosed by two similar walls upon the westernbank, in which case the site it occupied must have formed a roughquadrangle, divided diagonally by the river. No certain trace has yetbeen recovered of the western walls,[22] and all remains of buildingsseem to have disappeared completely on that side of the river. But forthe moment it may be assumed that the city did occupy approximately anequal amount of space upon the western bank; and, even so, its completecircuit would not have extended for more than about eleven miles, afigure very far short of any of those given by Herodotus, Ctesias andother writers.[Illustration: FIG. 3.PLAN OF THE RUINS OF BABYLON.A: The mound Babil.

But even if we accept that solution, it leavesthe still larger figure of Herodotus unexplained. It is preferableto regard all such estimates of size, not as based on accuratemeasurements, but merely as representing an impression of grandeurproduced on the mind of their recorder, whether by a visit to the cityitself, or by reports of its magnificence at second-hand.The excavators have not as yet devoted much attention to the city-wall,and, until more extensive digging has been carried out, it will not bepossible to form a very detailed idea of the system of fortification.But enough has already been done to prove that the outer wall was avery massive structure, and consisted of two separate walls with theintermediate space filled in with rubble. The outer wall, or face,which bore the brunt of any attack and rose high above the moatencircling the city, was of burnt brick set in bitumen. It measuredmore than seven metres in thickness, and below ground-level was furtherprotected from the waters of the moat by an additional wall, morethan three metres in thickness, and, like it, constructed of burntbrick with bitumen as mortar. Behind the outer wall, at a distanceof some twelve metres from it, was a second wall of nearly the samethickness. This faced inward towards the city, and so was constructedof crude or unburnt brick, as it would not be liable to direct assaultby a besieger; and the mortar employed was clay.[23] The crude-brickwall cannot be dated accurately, but it is certainly older than thereign of Nebuchadnezzar, and in his father's time it probably formedthe outer city's sole protection.[24] The burnt-brick wall and themoat-lining in front of it date, in their present form, from the age ofNebuchadnezzar, for they are built of his square bricks, impressed withhis usual stamp, which are so common over the whole site of Babylon.[Illustration: FIG. 4.GROUND-PLAN OF PART OF THE OUTER CITY-WALL.A: Outer moat-lining of burnt-brick. B: Moat. C: Inner moat-lining ofburnt-brick. D: Outer wall of burnt-brick. E: Rubble-filling. F: Innerwall of crude brick, with towers built at intervals across it. Thefigures on the plan give measurements in metres.(After Koldewey and Andrae.)]At intervals along the crude-brick wall were towers projecting slightlybeyond each face.[25] Only the bases of the towers have been preserved,so that any restoration of their upper structure must rest on pureconjecture. But, as rubble still fills the space between the twowalls of burnt and unburnt brick, it may be presumed that the fillingwas continued up to the crown of the outer wall. It is possible thatthe inner wall of crude brick was raised to a greater height andformed a curtain between each pair of towers. But even so, the clearspace in front, consisting of the rubble filling and the burnt-brickwall, formed a broad roadway nearly twenty metres in breadth, whichextended right round the city along the top of the wall. On thispoint the excavations have fully substantiated the account given byHerodotus, who states that "on the top, along the edges of the wall,they constructed buildings of a single chamber facing one another,leaving between them room for a four-horse chariot to turn."[26] Evenif smaller towers were built upon the outer edge, there would have beenfully enough space to drive a team of four horses abreast along thewall, and in the intervals between the towers two such chariots mighteasily have passed each other. It has been acutely noted that thisdesign of the wall was not only of protection by reason of its size,but was also of great strategic value; for it enabled the defence tomove its forces with great speed from one point to another, whereverthe attack at the moment might be pressed.[27]In fact it is only in the matter of size and extent that thedescription given by Herodotus of the walls of Babylon is to bediscounted; and those are just the sort of details that an ancienttraveller would accept without question from his local guide. His totalnumber for the city-gates is also no doubt excessive,[28] but hisdescription of the wall itself as built of burnt-brick tallies exactlywith the construction of its outer face, which would have been the onlyportion visible to any one passing outside the city. Moreover, in oneportion of the wall, as reconstructed by Nebuchadnezzar, its inner aswell as its outer half appears to have been formed of burnt-brick. Thisis the small rectangular extension, which Nebuchadnezzar threw out toprotect his later citadel now covered by the mound known as Babil.[29]The mound of Babil represents Nebuchadnezzar's latest addition to thecity's system of fortification, and its construction in advance ofthe old line of the outer walls was dictated by the desire, of whichwe find increasing evidence throughout his reign, to strengthen thecapital against attack from the north. The mound has not yet beensystematically excavated, but enough has been done to prove that, likethe great citadel upon the Ḳaṣr, it protected a royal palace consistingof a large number of chambers and galleries grouped around open courts.From this fact it is clear that a Babylonian citadel was not simply afortress to be used by the garrison for the defence of the city as awhole: it was also a royal residence, into which the monarch and hiscourt could shut themselves for safety should the outer wall of thecity itself be penetrated. Even in times of peace the king dwelt there,and the royal stores and treasury, as well as the national armouryand arsenal, were housed in its innumerable magazines. In the case ofthe Southern Citadel of Babylon, on which excavations have now beencontinuously carried out for sixteen years, we shall see that it formeda veritable township in itself. It was a city within a city, a secondBabylon in miniature.[30]The Southern or chief Citadel was built on the mound now known asthe Ḳaṣr, and within it Nebuchadnezzar erected his principal palace,partly over an earlier building of his father Nabopolassar. The palaceand citadel occupy the old city-square or centre of Babylon, whichis referred to in the inscriptions as the _irsit Babili,_ "the Bâbilplace."[31] Though far smaller in extent than Nebuchadnezzar's citadel,we may conclude that the chief fortress of Babylon always stood uponthis site, and the city may well have derived its name Bâb-ilî, "theGate of the Gods," from the strategic position of its ancient fortress,commanding as it does, the main approach to E-sagila, the famous templeof the city-god.[32] The earliest ruins in Babylon, which date fromthe age of Hammurabi and the First Dynasty of West-Semitic kings,lie under the mound of Merkes[33] just to the east of E-sagila andthe Tower of Babylon, proving that the first capital clustered aboutthe shrine of the city-god. The streets in that quarter suffered butlittle change, and their main lines remained unaltered down through theKassite period into Neo-Babylonian and later times.[34] It was naturalthat even in the earlier period the citadel should have been plantedup-stream, to the north of city and temple, since the greatest dangerof invasion was always from the north.[Illustration: FIG. 5.CONJECTURAL RESTORATION OF THE SOUTHERN CITADEL.The view is reconstructed from the north, the conventional mound inthe foreground covering the Central Citadel now partially excavated.The Sacred Road passes through the Ishtar Gate and along the east sideof the palace; further to the east and within the fortifications isthe small temple of Ninmakh. The innermost wall encloses the palaceof Nebuchadnezzar with its four open courts; the façade of the ThroneRoom, with three entrances, is visible in the Great Court. The flatroofs of the palace are broken here and there by smaller courts orlight-wells. Compare the ground-plan on p. 30, Fig. 6.(After Andrae.)]The outer city-wall, already described, dates only from theNeo-Babylonian period, when the earlier and smaller city expanded withthe prosperity which followed the victories of Nabopolassar and hisson. The eastern limits of that earlier city, at any rate toward theclose of the Assyrian domination, did not extend beyond the inner wall,which was then the only line of defence and was directly connectedwith the main citadel. The course of the inner wall may still betraced for a length of seventeen hundred metres by the low ridge orembankment,[35] running approximately north and south, from a pointnorth-east of the mound Homera.[36] It was a double fortification,consisting of two walls of crude or unburnt brick, with a space betweenof rather more than seven metres. The thicker of the walls, on thewest, which is six and a half metres in breadth, has large towers builtacross it, projecting deeply on the outer side, and alternating withsmaller towers placed lengthwise along it. The outer or eastern wallhas smaller towers at regular intervals. Now along the north side ofthe main or Southern Citadel run a pair of very similar walls,[37] alsoof crude brick, and they are continued eastward of the citadel to apoint where, in the Persian period, the Euphrates through a change ofcourse destroyed all further trace of them.[38] We may confidentlyassume that in the time of Nebuchadnezzar[39] they were linked up withthe inner city-wall to the north of Homeni and formed its continuationafter it turned at right angles on its way towards the river-bank.This line of fortification is of considerable interest, as there isreason to believe it may represent the famous double-line of Babylon'sdefences, which is referred to again and again in the inscriptions.[Illustration: FIG. 6.PLAN OF THE SOUTHERN CITADEL.A: East Court of the Palace of Nebuchadnezzar.

If they had been deposited in the thicker or innerwall, then Nimitti-Bêl must have been a double line of fortification,and both walls together must have borne the name; and in that case wemust seek elsewhere for Imgur-Bêl. But it is equally possible that theycame from the narrow or outer wall; and on this alternative Nimitti-Bêlmay be the outer one and Imgur-Bêl the broader inner-wall with thewidely projecting towers. It is true that only further excavation cansettle the point; but meanwhile the fortifications on the Ḳaṣr havesupplied further evidence which seems to support the latter view.[Illustration: FIG. 7.GROUND-PLAN OF QUAY-WALLS AND FORTIFICATION-WALLS IN THE N.W.

The quays and moat-walls aredistinguished by dotting.(After Koldewey.)]The extensive alterations which took place in the old citadel'sfortifications, especially during Nebuchadnezzar's long reign offorty-three years, led to the continual dismantling of earlierstructures and the enlargement of the area enclosed upon the north andwest. This is particularly apparent in its north-west corner. Here,at a considerable depth below the later fortification-walls, werefound the remains of four earlier walls,[42] the discovery of whichhas thrown considerable light on the topography of this portion ofBabylon. All four are ancient quay-walls, their northern and westernfaces sloping sharply inwards as they rise. Each represents a freshrebuilding of the quay, as it was gradually extended to the northand west. Fortunately, stamped and inscribed bricks were employed inconsiderable quantities in their construction, so that it is possibleto date the periods of rebuilding accurately.The earliest of the quay-walls, which is also the earliest buildingyet recovered on the Ḳaṣr, is the most massive of the four,[43] andis strengthened at the angle with a projecting circular bastion.It is the work of Sargon of Assyria,[44] who states the object ofthe structure in a text inscribed upon several of its bricks. Afterreciting his own name and titles, he declares that it was his desire torebuild Imgur-Bêl; that with this object he caused burnt-bricks to befashioned, and built a quay-wall with pitch and bitumen in the depthof the water from beside the Ishtar Gate to the bank of the Euphrates;and he adds that he "founded Imgur-Bêl and Nimitti-Bêl mountain-highupon it."[45] The two walls of Sargon, which he here definitely namesas Imgur-Bêl and Nimitti-Bêl, were probably of crude brick, andwere, no doubt, demolished and replaced by the later structures ofNabopolassar's and Nebuchadnezzar's reigns. But they must have occupiedapproximately the same position as the two crude brick walls abovethe quay of Sargon,[46] which run from the old bank of the Euphratesto the Ishtar Gate, precisely the two points mentioned in Sargon'stext. His evidence is therefore strongly in favour of identifyingthese later crude-brick walls, which we have already connected withthe inner city-wall, as the direct successors of his Imgur-Bêl and hisNimitti-Bêl, and therefore as inheritors of the ancient names.[Illustration: FIG. 8.SECTION OF THE QUAY-WALLS AND FORTIFICATION-WALLS ALONG THE NORTH FRONTOF THE SOUTHERN CITADEL.A: Sargon's quay-wall. B: Older moat-wall. O: Later moat-wall ofNebuchadnezzar. D: Intermediate wall. E: South fortification-wall ofcrude brick, probably Imgur-Bêl. F: North fortification-wall of crudebrick, probably Nimitti-Bêl. G: North wall of Southern Citadel. H:Remains of older crude brick wall.(After Andrae.)]We find further confirmation of this view in one of the laterquay-walls, which succeeded that of Sargon. The three narrow wallsalready referred to[47] were all the work of Nabopolassar, andrepresent three successive extensions of the quay westward into the bedof the stream, which in the inscriptions upon their bricks is given thename of Arakhtu.[48] But the texts make no mention of the city-walls.No inscriptions at all have been found in the structure of the nextextension, represented by the wall B, which, like the latest quay-wall(C), is not rounded off in the earlier manner, but is strengthened atthe corner with a massive rectangular bastion. It was in this latestand most substantial of all the quay-walls that further inscriptionswere found referring to Imgur-Bêl. They prove that this wall wasthe work of Nebuchadnezzar, who refers in them to Nabopolassar'srestoration of Imgur-Bêl and records that he raised its banks withbitumen and burnt-brick mountain-high. It is therefore clear that thiswas the quay-wall of Imgur Bêl, which it supported in the manner ofSargon's earlier structure. That the less important Nimitti-Bêl is notmentioned in these texts does not necessitate our placing it elsewhere,in view of Sargon's earlier reference.We may therefore provisionally regard the two crude-brick walls alongthe Ḳaṣr's northern front[49] as a section of the famous defences ofBabylon, and picture them as running eastward till they meet the innercity-wall by Homera. The point at which they extended westward acrossthe Euphrates can, as yet, only be conjectured. But it is significantthat the angle of the western walls, which may still be traced undermounds to the north of Sinjar village,[50] is approximately in linewith the north front of the Ḳaṣr and the end of the inner wall byHomera. Including these western walls within our scheme, the earlierBabylon would have been rectangular in ground-plan, about a quarterof it only upon the right bank, and the portion east of the riverforming approximately a square. The Babylon of the Kassite period andof the First Dynasty must have been smaller still, its area coveringlittle more than the three principal mounds; and, though part of itsstreet net-work has been recovered, no trace of its fortifications hasapparently survived.The evidence relating to the city's walls and fortifications hasbeen summarized rather fully, as it has furnished the chief subjectof controversy in connexion with the excavations. It should be addedthat the view suggested above is not shared by Dr. Koldewey, whoseobjections to the proposed identification of Imgur-Bêl rest on hisinterpretation of two phrases in a cylinder of Nabopolassar, which wasfound out of place in _débris_ close to the east wall of the SouthernCitadel. In it Nabopolassar records his own restoration of Imgur-Bêl,which he tells us had fallen into decay, and he states that he "foundedit in the primæval abyss," adding the words, "I caused Babylon tobe enclosed with it towards the four winds."[51] From the referenceto the abyss, Dr. Koldewey concludes that it had deep foundations,and must therefore have been constructed of burnt, not crude, brick;while from the second phrase he correctly infers that it must haveformed a quadrilateral closed on all sides. But that, as we have seen,is precisely the ground-plan we obtain by including the remains ofwalls west of the river. And, in view of the well-known tendency toexaggeration in these Neo-Babylonian records, we should surely notcredit any single metaphor with the accuracy of a modern architect'sspecification. If a single section of the wall had been furnished,during restoration, with a burnt-brick substructure, it would have beenenough to justify the royal claim.The manner in which the Euphrates was utilized for the defenceand water-supply of the citadel has also been illustrated by theexcavations. The discovery of Sargon's inscriptions proved that inhis day the river flowed along the western face of his quay-wall;[52]while the inscriptions on bricks from the three successive quay-wallsof Nabopolassar[53] state, in each case, that he used them to rebuildthe wall of a channel he calls the "Arakhtu," using the name inprecisely the same way as Sargon refers to the Euphrates. The simplestexplanation is that in Nabopolassar's time the Arakhtu was the namefor that section of the Euphrates which washed the western side ofthe citadel, and that its use in any case included the portion of thecitadel-moat, or canal, along its northern face, which formed a basinopening directly upon the river.[54] The "Arakhtu" may thus have beena general term, not only for this basin, but for the whole water-frontfrom the north-west corner of the citadel to some point on the leftbank to the south of it. It may perhaps have been further extended toinclude the river frontage of the Tower of Babylon, since it was intothe Arakhtu that Sennacherib cast the tower on his destruction of thecity. Within this stretch of water, particularly along the northernquays, vessels and _keleks_ would have been moored which arrived downstream with supplies for the palace and the garrison. The Arakhtu, infact, may well have been the name for the ancient harbour or dock ofBabylon.Some idea of the appearance of the quays may be gathered from theright-hand corner of the restoration in Fig. 5.[55] It is true thatthe outer quay-wall appears to have been built to replace the innerone, while in the illustration both are shown. But since the heightof the citadel and of its walls was continually being raised, thearrangement there suggested is by no means impossible. But in the laterpart of his reign Nebuchadnezzar changed the aspect of the river-frontentirely. To the west of the quay-walls, in the bed of the river,he threw out a massive fortification with immensely thick walls,from twenty to twenty-five metres in breadth.[56] It was constructedentirely of burnt-brick and bitumen, and, from his reference to it inan inscription from Sippar, it would seem that his object in buildingit was to prevent the formation of sandbanks in the river, which in thepast may have caused the flooding of the left bank above E-Sagila.[57]A narrow channel[58] was left between it and the old quay, along whichthe river water continued to flow through gratings. This no doubtacted as an overflow for the old northern moat of the citadel, sincethe latter fed the supply-canal, which passed round the palace andmay still be traced along its south side.[59] It is possible that thesubsequent change in the course of the Euphrates may be traced in partto this huge river-fortification. Its massive structure suggests thatit had to withstand considerable water-pressure, and it may well haveincreased any tendency of the stream to break away eastward. Howeverthat may be, it is certain that for a considerable time during thePersian and Seleucid periods it flowed round to the eastward of theḲaṣr, close under three sides of the citadel and rejoined its formerbed to the north of Marduk's temple and the Tower of Babylon. Itscourse east of the Ishtar Gate is marked by a late embankment slopingoutwards, which supported the thicker of the crude-brick walls at thepoint where they suddenly break off.[60] Beyond this embankment onlymud and river sediment were found. The water-course to the south ofthe citadel is probably the point where the river turned again towardsthe channel it had deserted. A trench that was dug here showed thatthe present soil is formed of silt deposited by water, and beyond theremains of the earlier canal no trace of any building was recovered.This temporary change in the river's course, which the excavations havedefinitely proved, explains another puzzle presented by the classicaltradition--the striking discrepancy between the actual position ofthe principal ruins of Babylon in relation to the river and theirrecorded position in the Persian period. Herodotus,[61] for example,places the fortress with the palace of the kings (that is, the Ḳaṣr),on the opposite bank to the sacred precinct of Zeus Belus (that is,E-temen-anki, the Tower of Babylon). But we have now obtained proofthat they were separated at that time by the Euphrates, until the riverreturned to its former and present bed, probably before the close ofthe Seleucid period.The greater part of the Southern Citadel is occupied by the enormouspalace on which Nebuchadnezzar lavished his energies during so manyyears of his reign. On ascending the throne of Babylon, he foundthe ancient fortress a very different place to the huge structurehe bequeathed to his successors. He had lived there in his father'slife-time, but Nabopolassar had been content with a comparativelymodest dwelling. And when his son, flushed with his victory over thehosts of Egypt, returned to Babylon to take the hands of Bêl, he beganto plan a palace that should be worthy of the empire he had secured.Of the old palace of Nabopolassar, in which at first he was obligedto dwell, very little now remains. What is left of it constitutes theearliest building of which traces now exist within the palace area.Nebuchadnezzar describes it, before his own building operations, asextending from the Euphrates eastward to the Sacred Road; and the oldpalace-enclosure undoubtedly occupied that site. Traces of the oldfortification-wall have been found below the east front of the laterpalace, and the arched doorway which gave access to its open court,afterwards filled up and built over by Nebuchadnezzar, has been foundin a perfect state of preservation.[62][Illustration: III. The Throne Room in Nebuchadnezzar's palace atBabylon, showing the recess in the back wall where the throne oncestood.]The old palace itself[63] did not reach beyond the western side ofNebuchadnezzar's great court.[64] The upper structure, as we learn fromthe East India House Inscription,[65] was of crude brick, which wasdemolished for the later building. But Nabopolassar, following a customwhich had survived unchanged from the time of Hammurabi, had placedhis crude-brick walls upon burnt-brick foundations. These his son madeuse of, simply strengthening them before erecting his own walls uponthem. Thus this section of the new palace retained the old ground-planto a great extent unchanged. The strength and size of its walls areremarkable and may in part be explained by the crude-brick upperstructure of the earlier building, which necessarily demanded a broaderbase for its walls.When Nebuchadnezzar began building he dwelt in the old palace, whilehe strengthened the walls of its open court on the east and raised itslevel for the solid platform on which his own palace was to rise.[66]For a time the new and the old palace were connected by two ramps ofunburnt-brick,[67] which were afterwards filled in below the laterpavement of the great court; and we may picture the king ascendingthe ramps with his architect on his daily inspection of the work. Assoon as the new palace on the east was ready he moved into it, and,having demolished the old one, he built up his own walls upon itsfoundations, and filled in the intermediate spaces with earth andrubble until he raised its pavement to the eastern level. Still laterhe built out a further extension[68] along its western side. In theaccount he has left us of the palace-building the king says: "I laidfirm its foundation and raised it mountain-high with bitumen andburnt-brick. Mighty cedars I caused to be stretched out at length forits roofing. Door-leaves of cedar overlaid with copper, thresholdsand sockets of bronze I placed in its doorways. Silver and gold andprecious stones, all that can be imagined of costliness, splendour,wealth, riches, all that was highly esteemed, I heaped up within it, Istored up immense abundance of royal treasure therein."[69]A good general idea of the palace ground-plan, in its final form, maybe obtained from Fig. 6. The main entrance was in its eastern front,through a gate-way,[70] flanked on its outer side by towers, andknown as the Bûb Bêlti, or "Lady Gate," no doubt from its proximityto the temple of the goddess Ninmakh.[71] The gate-house consists ofan entrance hall, with rooms opening at the sides for the use of thepalace-guard. The eastern part of the palace is built to the north andsouth of three great open courts,[72] separated from each other bygateways[73] very like that at the main entrance to the palace. It willbe noticed that, unlike the arrangement of a European dwelling, thelarger rooms are always placed on the south side of the court facing tothe north, for in the sub-tropical climate of Babylonia the heat of thesummer sun was not courted, and these chambers would have been in theshade throughout almost the whole of the day.Some of the larger apartments, including possibly the chambers of theinner gateways, must have served as courts of justice, for from theHammurabi period onward we know that the royal palace was the resortof litigants, whose appeals in the earlier period were settled by theking himself,[74] and later by the judges under his supervision. Everykind of commercial business was carried on within the palace precincts,and not only were regular lawsuits tried, but any transaction thatrequired legal attestation was most conveniently carried throughthere. Proof of this may be seen in the fact that so many of theNeo-Babylonian contracts that have been recovered on the site ofBabylon are dated from the Al-Bît-shar-Bâbili, "the City of the Kingof Babylon's dwelling," doubtless a general title for the citadel andpalace-area. All government business was also transacted here, and wemay provisionally assign to the higher ministers and officials of thecourt the great apartment and the adjoining dwellings on the south sideof the Central Court of the palace.[75] For many of the more importantofficers in the king's service were doubtless housed on the premises;and to those of lower rank we may assign the similar but rathersmaller dwellings, which flank the three courts on the north and theEntrance Court upon the south side as well. Even royal manufactorieswere carried on within the palace, to judge from the large number ofalabaster jars, found beside their cylindrical cores, in one room inthe south-west corner by the outer palace-wall.[76]It will be seen from the ground-plan that these dwellings consistof rooms built around open courts or light-wells; most of them areseparate dwellings, isolated from their neighbours, and having doorsopening on to the greater courts or into passage-ways running up fromthem. No trace of any windows has been found within the buildings,and it is probable that they were very sparsely employed. But we mustnot conclude that they were never used, since no wall of the palacehas been preserved for more than a few feet in height, and, for thegreater part, their foundations only have survived. But there is nodoubt that, like the modern houses of the country, all the dwellings,whether in palace or city, had flat roofs, which formed the naturalsleeping-place for their inhabitants during the greater part of theyear. Towards sunset, when the heat of the day was past, they wouldascend to the house-tops to enjoy the evening breeze; during the day awindow would have been merely a further inlet for the sun. The generalappearance of the palace is no doubt accurately rendered in the sketchalready given.[77][Illustration Fig. 9.PLAN OF THE THRONE ROOM OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR AND PART OF THE PRIVATEPALACE.C: Great Court. F: Throne Room, _a:_ Recess in back-wall for throne,_b-d:_ Entrances to Throne Room from Court, _e-g_: Entrances from sideand back. 1-3: Open courts, surrounded by rooms for the royal service.4, 5: Open courts in the south-east corner of the Private Palace.(After Koldewey.)]The most interesting apartment within the palace is one that maybe identified as Nebuchadnezzar's Throne Room. This is the roomimmediately to the south of the Great Court.[78] It is the largestchamber of the palace, and since the walls on the longer sides aresix metres thick, far broader than those at the ends, it is possiblethat they supported a barrel-vaulting. It has three entrances from thecourt,[79] and in the back wall opposite the centre one is a broadniche, doubly recessed into the structure of the wall, where we mayassume the royal throne once stood. During any elaborate court ceremonythe king would thus have been visible upon his throne, not only tothose within the chamber, but also from the central portion of theGreat Court. It was in this portion of the palace that some traces ofthe later Babylonian methods of mural decoration were discovered. For,while the inner walls of the Throne Room were merely washed over with aplaster of white gypsum, the brickwork of the outer façade, which facedthe court, was decorated with brightly-coloured enamels.[Illustration: FIG. 10.DESIGN IN ENAMELLED BRICK FROM THE FAÇADE OF THE THRONE ROOMIn the drawing light and dark blue are indicated by light and heavyhorizontal shading; yellow by a dotted surface.]Only fragments of the enamelled surface were discovered, but thesesufficed to restore the scheme of decoration. A series of yellowcolumns with bright blue capitals, both edged with white borders, standout against a dark blue ground. The capitals are the most strikingfeature of the composition. Each consists of two sets of doublevolutes, one above the other, and a white rosette with yellow centrecomes partly into sight above them. Between each member is a bud insheath, forming a trefoil, and linking the volutes of the capitals bymeans of light blue bands which fall in a shallow curve from eitherside of it. Still higher on the wall ran a frieze of double palmettesin similar colouring, between yellow line-borders, the centres of thelatter picked out with lozenges coloured black and yellow, and blackand white, alternately. The rich effect of this enamelled façade of theThrone Room was enhanced by the decoration of the court gateway, thesurface of which was adorned in a like fashion with figures of lions.So too were the gateways of the other eastern courts, to judge fromthe fragments of enamel found there, but the rest of the court-wallswere left undecorated or, perhaps, merely received a coat of plaster.The fact that the interior of the Throne Room, like the rest of thechambers of the palace, was without ornamentation of any sort favoursthe view that heat, and light with it, was deliberately excluded by theabsence of windows in the walls.The chambers behind the Throne Room, reached by two doorways in theback wall,[80] were evidently for the king's service, and are rangedaround three open courts; and in the south-west corners of two ofthem, which lie immediately behind the Throne Room wall, are wells,their positions indicated on the plan by small open circles. Thewalls of each of these small chambers are carried down through thefoundations to water-level, and the intermediate space is filled inaround the wells with rubble-packing. This device was evidently adoptedto secure an absolutely pure supply of water for the royal table.But the private part of the palace, occupied by the women and therest of the royal household, was evidently further to the west, builtover the earlier dwelling of Nabopolassar. It will be seen from theground-plan that this is quite distinct from the eastern or officialportion of the palace, from which it is separated by a substantial walland passage-way running, with the Great Court, the whole width of thepalace-area. The character of the gateway-building, which formed itschief entrance and opened on the Great Court, is also significant.[81]For the towers, flanking the gateways to the official courts, arehere entirely absent, and the pathway passes through two successiveapartments, the second smaller than the first and with a porters'service-room opening off it. The entrance for the king's own use wasin the southern half of the passage-way, and lies immediately betweenthe side entrance to the Throne Room[82] and another doorway in thepassage leading to one of the small courts behind it.[83] In two of thechambers within the private palace, both opening on to Court 5, aretwo more circular wells, walled in for protection, and here too thefoundations of each chamber are carried down to water-level and filledin with brick-rubble, as in the case of the wells behind the ThroneRoom.The same care that was taken to ensure the purity of the water-supplymay also be detected in the elaborate drainage-system, with whichthe palace was provided, with the object of carrying off thesurface-water from the flat palace-roofs, the open courts, and thefortification-walls. The larger drains were roofed with corbelledcourses; the smaller ones, of a simpler but quite effectiveconstruction, were formed of bricks set together in the shape of a Vand closed in at the top with other bricks laid flat. The tops ofthe fortifications, both in the citadel itself and on the outer andinner city-wall, were drained by means of vertical shafts, or gutters,running down within the solid substructures of the towers; and in thecase of crude-brick buildings these have a lining of burnt-brick. Insome of the temples, which, as we shall see, were invariably built ofcrude brick,[84] this form of drainage was also adopted.[Illustration: FIG. 11.PLAN OF THE NORTH-EAST CORNER OF THE PALACE WITH THE VAULTED BUILDING.A: East Court of the Palace.

J: Southern fortification-wall of crude brick,probably Imgur-Bêl. _h_: Passage-way leading to the Vaulted Building,_m_, _n_: Entrances to the Vaulted Building. 1-15: Small open courts orlight-wells in official residencies.(After Koldewey.)]One other building within the palace deserves mention, as it has beensuggested that it may represent the remains of the famous HangingGardens of Babylon.[85] It is reached from the north-east corner ofthe Central Court[86] along a broad passage-way,[87] from which abranch passage turns off at right angles; and on the left side of thisnarrower passage are its two entrances.[88] It must be confessed thatat first sight the ground-plan of this building does not suggest agarden of any sort, least of all one that became famous as a wonderof the ancient world. It will be seen that the central part, or core,of the building is surrounded by a strong wall and within are fourteennarrow cells or chambers, seven on each side of a central gangway.[89]The cells were roofed in with semicircular arches, forming a barrelvault over each; and the whole is encircled by a narrow corridor,flanked on the north and east sides by the outer palace-wall. Thispart of the building, both the vaulted chambers and the surroundingcorridor, lies completely below the level of the rest of the palace.The small chambers, some of them long and narrow like the vaults, whichenclose the central core upon the west and south, are on the palacelevel; and the subterranean portion is reached by a stairway in one ofthe rooms on the south side.[90]There are two main reasons which suggested the identification of thisbuilding with the Hanging Gardens. The first is that hewn stone wasused in its construction, which is attested by the numerous brokenfragments discovered among its ruins. With the exception of the SacredRoad and the bridge over the Euphrates, there is only one other placeon the whole site of Babylon where hewn stone is used in bulk forbuilding purposes, and that is the northern wall of the Ḳaṣr. Now, inall the literature referring to Babylon, stone is only recorded tohave been used for buildings in two places, and those are the northwall of the Citadel and in the Hanging Gardens, a lower layer in thelatter's roofing, below the layer of earth, being described as made ofstone. These facts certainly point to the identification of the VaultedBuilding with the Hanging Gardens.[91] Moreover, Berossus definitelyplaces them within the buildings by which Nebuchadnezzar enlarged hisfather's palace; but this reference would apply equally to the laterCentral Citadel constructed by Nebuchadnezzar immediately to the northof his main palace. The size of the building is also far greater inStrabo and Diodorus than that of the Vaulted Building, the side of thequadrangle, according to these writers, measuring about four times thelatter's length. But discrepancy in figures of this sort, as we havealready seen in the case of the outer walls of the city, is easilyexplicable and need not be reckoned as a serious objection.[92]The second reason which pointed to the identification is that, in oneof the small chambers near the south-west corner of the outer fringe ofrooms on those two sides, there is a very remarkable well. It consistsof three adjoining shafts, a square one in the centre flanked by two ofoblong shape. This arrangement, unique so far as the remains of ancientBabylon are concerned, may be most satisfactorily explained on theassumption that we here have the water-supply for a hydraulic machine,constructed on the principle of a chain-pump. The buckets, attached toan endless chain, would have passed up one of the outside wells, overa great wheel fixed above them, and, after emptying their water intoa trough as they passed, would have descended the other outside wellfor refilling. The square well in the centre obviously served as aninspection-chamber, down which an engineer could descend to clean thewell out, or to remove any obstruction. In the modern contrivances ofthis sort, sometimes employed to-day in Babylonia to raise a continuousflow of water to the irrigation-trenches, the motive-power for turningthe winch is supplied by horses or other animals moving round in acircle. In the Vaulted Building there would have been scarcely roomfor such an arrangement, and it is probable that gangs of slaves wereemployed to work a couple of heavy hand-winches. The discovery of thewell undoubtedly serves to strengthen the case for identification.[Illustration: EASTERN TOWERS OF THE ISHTAR GATE]Two alternative schemes are put forward to reconstitute the upperstructure of this building. Its massive walls suggest in any casethat they were intended to support a considerable weight, and it maybe that the core of the building, constructed over the subterraneanvaults, towered high above its surrounding chambers which are on thepalace-level. This would have been in accordance with the currentconception of a hanging garden; and, since on two sides it was boundedby the palace-wall, its trees and vegetation would have been visiblefrom outside the citadel. Seen thus from the lower level of the town,the height of the garden would have been reinforced by the whole heightof the Citadel-mound on which the palace stands, and imagination oncekindled might have played freely with its actual measurements.On the other hand, the semicircular arches, still preserved within thecentral core, may have directly supported the thick layer of earth inwhich the trees of the garden were planted. These would then have beengrowing on the palace-level, as it were in a garden-court, perhapssurrounded by a pillared colonnade with the outer chambers opening onto it on the west and south sides. In either scheme the subterraneanvaults can only have been used as stores or magazines, since they wereentirely without light. As a matter of fact, a large number of tabletswere found in the stairway-chamber that leads down to them; and, sincethe inscriptions upon them relate to grain, it would seem that some atleast were used as granaries. But this is a use to which they couldonly have been put if the space above them was not a garden, wateredcontinuously by an irrigation-pump, as moisture would have been boundto reach the vaults.[93]Whichever alternative scheme we adopt, it must be confessed that theHanging Gardens have not justified their reputation. And if they merelyformed a garden-court, as Dr. Koldewey inclines to believe, it isdifficult to explain the adjectives [κρεμαστός] and _pensilis._ For thesubterranean vaults would have been completely out of sight, and, evenwhen known to be below the pavement-level, were not such as to excitewonder or to suggest the idea of suspension in the air. One cannot helpsuspecting that the vaulted building may really, after all, be nothingmore than the palace granary, and the triple well one of the mainwater-supplies for domestic use. We may, at least for the present, bepermitted to hope that a more convincing site for the gardens will befound in the Central Citadel after further excavation.[Illustration: FIG. 12. BULL IN ENAMELLED BRICK FROM THE ISHTAR GATE.]In the autumn of 1901 the writer spent some time in Babylon, stoppingwith Dr. Koldewey in the substantial expedition-house they have builtwith fine burnt-brick from Nebuchadnezzar's palace. At that time he haduncovered a good deal of the palace, and it was even then possible totrace out the walls of the Throne Room and note the recess where thethrone itself had stood. But, beyond the fragments of the enamelledfaçade, little of artistic interest had been found, and on otherportions of the site the results had been still more disappointing. Thedeep excavation of E-sagila had already been made, the temple of thegoddess Ninmakh had been completely excavated, and work was in fullswing on that of the god Ninib. All proved to be of unburnt brick,[94]and the principal decoration of the walls was a thin lime-wash. Theirdiscoverer was inclined to be sceptical of Babylon's fabled splendour.[Illustration: FIG. 13. DRAGON IN ENAMELLED BRICK FROM THE ISHTAR GATE.]But in the following spring he made the discovery which still remainsthe most striking achievement of the expedition, and has rehabilitatedthe fame of that ancient city. This was the great Ishtar Gate, whichspanned Babylon's Sacred Way, and the bulls and dragons with which itwas adorned have proved that the glyptic art of Babylonia attained ahigh level of perfection during its later period. The gate was erectedat the point where the Sacred Way entered the older city. It was, infact, the main gate in the two walls of crude brick along the northside of the Citadel, which we have seen reason to believe were thefamous defences, Imgur-Bêl and Nimitti-Bêl.[95] Its structure, whenrebuilt by Nebuchadnezzar, was rather elaborate.[96] It is a doublegateway consisting of two separate gate-houses,[97] each with anouter and an inner door.[98] The reason for this is that the line offortification is a double one, and each of its walls has a gateway ofits own. But the gates are united into a single structure by means ofshort connecting walls, which complete the enclosure of the GatewayCourt.[99][Illustration: FIG. 14.GROUND-PLAN OF THE ISHTAR GATE.The ground-plan of the gateway is indicated in black; other walls andbuildings are hatched.

H:North-east corner of Palace. K: Temple of the goddess Ninmakh. S: Stepsleading down from level of Sacred Way. 1, 2: Doorways of outer gate. 3,4: Doorways of inner gate.(After Koldewey.)]Dr. Koldewey considers it probable that this court was roofed in, toprotect the great pair of doors, which swung back into it, from theweather. But if so, the whole roofing of the gateway must have been atthe same low level; whereas the thick walls of the inner gate-housesuggest that it and its arched doorways rose higher than the outergateway, as is suggested in the section[100] and in the reconstructionof the Citadel.[101][Illustration: FIG. 15.SECTION OF THE ISHTAR GATE.The section is conjecturally restored, looking from west to east; theindex capitals and figures correspond to those in Fig. 14. A: SacredWay to north of gate. B: Gate of outer wall. C: Gateway Court. D: Gateof inner wall. G: Sacred way to south of gate. 1, 2: Doorways ofouter gate. 3, 4: Doorways of inner gate, _a_: Traces of pavement. 6:Level of second pavement, _c_: Level of final pavement. _d_: Presentground-level, _e_: Level of ground before excavation. It will benoticed that the portions of the gate preserved are all below the finalpavement-level.(After Andrae.)]It thus appears more probable that the court between the two gatewayswas left open, and that the two inner arches[102] rose far higherthan those of the outer gate.[103] And there is the more reason forthis, as an open court would have given far more light for viewing theremarkable decoration of the gateway upon its inner walls.It will be noticed in the plan that the central roadway is not theonly entrance through the gate; on each side of the two centralgate-houses a wing is thrown out, making four wings in all. These alsoare constructed of burnt-brick, and they serve to connect the gate withthe two fortification-walls of unburnt brick. In each wing is a furtherdoor, giving access to the space between the walls. Thus, in all, thegate has three separate entrances, and no less than eight doorways,four ranged along the central roadway, and two in each double wing.[Illustration: FIG. 16.DIAGRAM TO SHOW THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BEASTS OF THE ISHTAR GATE.The ground-plan of the gate is shown in outline, the arrows indicatingthe positions of Bulls or Dragons still in place upon its walls. Thehead of each arrow points in the same direction as the beast to whichit refers. Where no beasts are preserved, the foundations of thestructure are indicated by a dotted line. The index letters correspondto those in Fig. 14.(After Koldewey.)]The whole wall-surface of the gateway on its northern side, bothcentral towers and side-wings, was decorated with alternate rows ofbulls and dragons in brick relief, the rows ranged one above theother up the surface of walls and towers. The decoration is continuedover the whole interior surface of the central gateways and may betraced along the southern front of the inner gate-house. The beastsare arranged in such a way that to any one entering the city theywould appear as though advancing to meet him. In the accompanyingdiagram,[104] which gives the ground-plan of the gate in outline, thearrows indicate the positions of beasts that are still in place uponthe walls, and the head of each arrow points in the direction thatanimal faces. It will be noticed that along most of the walls runningnorth and south the beasts face northwards, while on the transversewalls they face inwards towards the centre. One end-wall in chamber Bis preserved, and there, for the sake of symmetry, the two animals faceeach other, advancing from opposite directions. It has been calculatedthat at least five hundred and seventy-five of these creatures wererepresented on the walls and towers of the gateway. Some of the walls,with their successive tiers of beasts, are still standing to a heightof twelve metres. The two eastern towers of the outer gate-house arethe best preserved, and even in their present condition they conveysome idea of the former magnificence of the building.In the greater part of the structure that still remains in place, itis apparent that the brickwork was very roughly finished, and that thebitumen employed as mortar has been left where it has oozed out betweenthe courses. The explanation is that the portions of the gateway whichstill stand are really foundations of the building, and were alwaysintended to be buried below the pavement level. It is clear thatthe height of the road-way was constantly raised while the buildingof the gate was in progress, and there are traces of two temporarypavements,[105] afterwards filled in when the final pavement-level[106]was reached.[107] The visible portion of the gate above the lastpavement has been entirely destroyed, but among its _débris_ were foundthousands of fragments of the same two animals, but in enamelled brickof brilliant colouring, white and yellow against a blue ground. Someof these have been laboriously pieced together in Berlin, and specimensare now exhibited in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum and in the ImperialOttoman Museum at Constantinople. Only one fragment of an enamelledportion of the wall was found in place,[108] and that was below thefinal pavement. It shows the legs of a bull above a band of rosetteswith yellow centres.[109][Illustration: FIG. 17.ENAMELLED FRAGMENT OF THE ISHTAR GATE STILL IN POSITION.The fragment, which was the highest portion of the gate preserved, isfrom the east side of the second doorway of the outer gate; cf. Figs.14 and 15, No. 2. It stands just below the final pavement-level, andonly the upper portion is enamelled.]The delicate modelling of the figures is to some extent obscured in thefoundation specimens, but the imperfections there visible are entirelyabsent from the enamelled series. An examination of the latter showsthat the bricks were separately moulded, and, before the process ofenamelling, were burnt in the usual way. The contours of the figureswere then outlined in black with a vitreous paste, the surfaces sodefined being afterwards filled in with coloured liquid enamels. Thepaste of the black outlines and the coloured enamels themselves hadevidently the same fusing point, for when fired they have sometimesshaded off into one another, giving a softness and a pleasing varietyof tone to the composition.[110] It should be added that the enamelledbeasts, like those in plain brick, are in slight relief, the samemoulds having been employed for both.[Illustration: FIG. 18.PLAN OF THE LATER DEFENCES OF THE CITADEL UPON THE NORTH, SHOWING THEWALLS WITH THE LION FRIEZE AND THE ISHTAR GATE.A: Sacred Way.

N.B.--The two arrows denotethe direction in which the lions are represented as advancing in thefrieze.]Before the Neo-Babylonian period the Ishtar Gate had defended thenorthern entrance to the city, and was probably a massive structure ofunburnt brick without external decoration. But, with the building ofthe outer city-wall, it stood in the second line of defence. And asNebuchadnezzar extended the fortifications of the Citadel itself uponthe northern side, it lost still more of its strategic importance, andfrom its interior position became a fit subject for the decorator'sart. The whole course of the roadway through these exterior defenceshe flanked with mighty walls, seven metres thick, extending from thegate northwards to the outermost wall and moat.[111] Their greatstrength was dictated by the fact that, should an enemy penetratethe outer city-wall, he would have to pass between them, under thegarrison's fire, to reach the citadel-gate. But these, like the gateitself, formed a secondary or interior defence, and so, like it, wereelaborately decorated. The side of each wall facing the roadway wasadorned with a long frieze of lions, in low relief and brilliantlyenamelled, which were represented advancing southwards towards theIshtar Gate. The surface of each wall was broken up into panels by aseries of slightly projecting towers, each panel probably containingtwo lions, while the plinth below the Lion Frieze was decorated withrosettes. There appear to have been sixty lions along each wall. Somewere in white enamel with yellow manes, while others were in yellow andhad red manes,[112] and they stood out against a light or dark blueground. Leading as they did to the bulls and dragons of the gateway, wecan realize in some degree the effect produced upon a stranger enteringthe inner city of Babylon for the first time.[Illustration: FIG. 19.LION FROM THE FRIEZE OF THE SACRED WAY TO THE NORTH OF THE ISHTAR GATE.]Such a stranger, passing within the Ishtar Gate, would have been struckwith wonder at the broad Procession Street,[113] which ran its longcourse straight through the city from north to south, with the greattemples ranged on either hand. Its foundation of burnt brick coveredwith bitumen is still preserved, upon which, to the south of thegateway, rested a pavement of massive flags, the centre of fine hardlimestone, the sides of red breccia veined with white. In inscriptionsupon the edges of these paving slabs, formerly hidden by their asphaltmortar, Nebuchadnezzar boasts that he paved the street of Babylon forthe procession of the great lord Marduk, to whom he prays for eternallife.[114] The slabs that are still in place are polished with harduse, but, unlike the pavements of Pompeii, show no ruts or indentationssuch as we might have expected from the chariots of the later period.It is possible that, in view of its sacred character, the use of theroad was restricted to foot passengers and beasts of burden, exceptwhen the king and his retinue passed along it through the city. And inany case, not counting chariots of war and state, there was probablyvery little wheeled traffic in Babylonia at any time.When clear of the citadel the road descends by a gradual slope to thelevel of the plain, and preserving the same breadth, passes to theright of the temple dedicated to Ishtar of Akkad.[115] As it continuessouthward it is flanked at a little distance on the east by the streetsof private houses, whose foundations have been uncovered in the Merkesmound;[116] and on the west side it runs close under the huge peribolosof E-temen-anki, the Tower of Babylon.[117] As far as the main gate ofE-temen-anki[118] its foundation is laid in burnt-brick, over which wasan upper paving completely formed of breccia. The inscription upon theslabs corresponds to that on the breccia paving-stones opposite thecitadel; but they have evidently been re-used from an earlier pavementof Sennacherib, whose name some of them bear upon the underside. Thisearlier pavement of Babylon's Sacred Way must have been laid by thatmonarch before he reversed his conciliatory policy toward the southernkingdom. At the south-east corner of the peribolos the road turns ata right angle and running between the peribolos and E-sagila, thegreat temple of the city-god, passes through a gate in the river-wallbuilt by Nabonidus, and so over the Euphrates bridge before turningsouthward again in the direction of Borsippa.[119] This branch roadbetween the Tower of Babylon and E-sagila[120] is undoubtedly thecontinuation of the procession-street. For not only was it the way ofapproach to Marduk's temple, but its course has been definitely tracedby excavation. But there can be no doubt that the upper portion of theroad, running north and south through the city, was continued in astraight line from the point where the Sacred Way branched off. Thiswould have conducted an important stream of traffic to the maingate in the southern city-wall, passing on its way between the templesdedicated to the god Ninib and to another deity not yet identified.[121][Illustration: THE SACRED WAY OF BABYLON]Apart from the royal palaces, the five temples of Babylon were theprincipal buildings within the city, and their excavation has thrownan entirely new light upon our ideas of the religious architecture ofthe country. The ground-plans of four of them have now been ascertainedin their entirety, and we are consequently in a position to form someidea of the general principles upon which such buildings were arranged.The first to be excavated was the little temple E-makh, dedicated tothe goddess Ninmakh, which, as we have already seen, was built on thecitadel itself, in the north-east corner of the open space to the southof the Ishtar Gateway. Its principal façade faces the north-west, and,since the eastern entrance of the Ishtar Gate opens just opposite thecorner of the temple, a wall with a doorway in it was thrown across,spanning the passage between temple and fortification.[122] The onlyentrance to the temple was in the centre of the façade; and in thepassage-way immediately in front of it, surrounded by a pavement ofburnt-brick, is a small crude-brick altar.[123] It is an interestingfact that the only other altar yet found in Babylon is also of crudebrick and occupies precisely the same position, outside a templeand immediately opposite its main entrance;[124] while in a thirdtemple, though the altar itself has disappeared, the paved area whichsurrounded it is still visible.[125] We may therefore conclude thatthis represents the normal position for the altar in the Babyloniancult; and it fully substantiates the statement of Herodotus that thetwo altars of Belus were outside his temple.[126] One of these, hetells us, was of solid gold, on which it was only lawful to offersucklings; the other was a common altar (doubtless of crude brick) butof great size, on which full-grown animals were sacrificed. It wasalso on the great altar that the Chaldeans burnt the frankincense,which, according to Herodotus, was offered to the amount of a thousandtalents' weight every year at the festival of the god.It may further be noted that this exterior position of the altarcorresponds to Hebrew usage, according to which the main altar waserected in the outer court in front of the temple proper. ThusSolomon's brazen altar, which under Phoenician influence took the placeof earlier altars of earth or unhewn stone,[127] stood before thetemple.[128] The altar within the Hebrew temple was of cedar-wood,[129]and it was clearly not a permanent structure embedded in the pavement,for Ezekiel refers to it as a "table," and states that it "was ofwood."[130] It was more in the nature of a table for offerings, and itmay be inferred that in earlier times it served as the table upon whichthe shewbread was placed before Yahwe.[131] The complete absence ofany trace of a permanent altar within the Babylonian temples can onlybe due to a similar practice; the altars or tables within the shrinesmust have been light wooden structures, and they were probably carriedoff or burnt when the temples were destroyed. There is of course noneed to regard this resemblance as due to direct cultural influenceor borrowing. But we may undoubtedly conclude that we here have anexample of parallelism in religious ritual between two races of thesame Semitic stock. What the Sumerian practice was in this respect wehave as yet no means of ascertaining; but in such details of cult itis quite possible that the Semitic Babylonians substituted their owntraditional usages for any other they may have found in the country oftheir adoption.The temple of Ninmakh itself, like all the others in Babylon, was builtof crude brick, and though its walls were covered with a thin plasteror wash of lime, only the simplest form of decoration in black andwhite was attempted, and that very sparingly.[132] The fact that thepractice of building in mud-brick should have continued at a time whenkiln-burnt and enamelled brick was lavished on the royal palaces, isprobably to be explained as a result of religious conservatism. Thearchitectural design does not differ in essentials from that employedfor buildings of a military character. It will be seen that the longexterior walls of E-makh resemble those of a fortification, theirsurface being broken up by slightly projecting towers set at regularintervals.[133] Larger rectangular towers flank the gateway, and twoothers, diminishing in size and probably also in height, are ranged oneither side of them. The vertical grooves, which traverse the exteriorfaces of the towers from top to bottom, constitute a characteristicform of temple embellishment, which is never found on buildings of asecular character. They may be either plain rectangular grooves, ormore usually, as in E-makh, are stepped when viewed in section.[134]In all the important doorways of the temples foundation-deposits wereburied in little niches or boxes, formed of six bricks placed togetherand hidden below the level of the pavement. The deposits found inplace are generally fashioned of baked clay, and that of most commonoccurrence is a small figure of the god Papsukal. One of those inNinmakh's temple was in the form of a bird, no doubt sacred to thegoddess. There is clear evidence that the object of their burial was toensure the safety of the entrance both from spiritual and from humanfoes. In addition to this magical protection the entrance was furthersecured by double doors, their pivots shod with bronze and turning inmassive stone sockets. The ordinary method of fastening such doorsby bolts was supplemented in the case of E-makh by a beam proppedagainst the doors and with its lower end fitting into a socket in thepavement. Since the temple was within the citadel fortifications, thepossibility was foreseen that it might have to be defended from assaultlike the secular buildings in its immediate neighbourhood.[Illustration: FIG. 20.GROUND-PLAN OF E-MAKH.A: Open Court.

The latteris on the south-east side, facing the entrance to the court, and,like the main gateway of the temple, the façade of the shrine and theflanking towers of its doorway were adorned with stepped grooves. Theshrine itself is approached through an ante-chamber, and each hasa small service-apartment opening out from it to the left. Againstthe back wall of the shrine, immediately opposite the doors, stoodthe cult image of the goddess, visible from the open court; this hasdisappeared, but the foundations of the low dais or postament, on whichit stood, are still in place.[Illustration: FIG. 21.CONJECTURAL RESTORATION OF E-MAKH, THE TEMPLE OF THE GODDESS NINMAKH.The view is taken from the north. The plain finish to the tops of wallsand towers is in accordance with one theory of reconstruction. Theconnecting wall between the temple and the east wing of the Ishtar Gateis omitted to simplify the drawing.(After Andrae.)]The long narrow passage behind the shrine[136] was thought at first byits discoverer to have served a secret purpose of the priesthood. Itwas suggested that it might have given access to a concealed openingin the back wall of the shrine, behind the image of the goddess,whence oracles could have been given forth with her authority. Butthere is a precisely similar passage along the north-east wall; and wemay probably accept the more prosaic explanation that they containedthe ramps or stairways that led up to the flat roof, though why twoshould have been required, both at the same end of the building, is notclear.[137] The precise use of the other chambers opening from thecourt cannot be identified with any certainty, as nothing was found inthem to indicate whether they served as apartments for the priesthoodor as magazines for temple-stores. Beyond a number of votive terracottafigures, no cult object was discovered. But around the dais for theimage of the goddess, the well in the courtyard for lustral water, andthe small crude-brick altar before the temple entrance, it is possibleto picture in imagination some of the rites to which reference is madein the Babylonian religious texts.As we have already seen was the case with the palace-buildings, theupper structure of all the temples has been completely destroyed,so that it is not now certain how the tops of walls and towers werefinished off. In the conjectural restoration of Ninmakh's temple[138]the upper portions are left perfectly plain. And this represents onetheory of reconstruction. But it is also possible that the walls werecrowned with the stepped battlements of military architecture. In therestoration of Assyrian buildings, both secular and religious, greatassistance has been obtained from the sculptured bas-reliefs that linedthe palace walls. For the scenes upon them include many representationsof buildings, and, when due allowance has been made for the conventionsemployed, a considerable degree of certainty may be attained withtheir help in picturing the external appearance of buildings ofwhich only the lower courses of the walls now remain. The scarcityof stone in Babylonia, and the consequent absence of mural reliefs,have deprived us of this source of information in the case of thesouthern kingdom. The only direct evidence on the point that has beenforthcoming consists of a design stamped in outline upon a rectangulargold plaque, found with other fragments of gold and jewellery in theremains of a sumptuous burial within the structure of Nabopolassar'spalace.[139] The period of the burial is certain, for the grave inwhich the great pottery sarcophagus was placed had been closed withbricks of Nebuchadnezzar, who afterwards built his strengthening wallagainst it. It must therefore date from the earlier part of his reign,and Dr. Koldewey makes the suggestion that it was perhaps the tomb ofNabopolassar himself.[140] However that may be, the grave is certainlyof the early Neo-Babylonian period, and the architectural design uponthe gold plaque may be taken as good evidence for that time.[Illustration: FIG. 22.GOLD PLAQUE, WITH ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN, PROM A NEO-BABYLONIAN BURIAL.The engraving on the plaque shows a city-gate with flanking towers andstepped battlements. (Enlargement after photo, by Koldewey.)]The plaque formed the principal decoration in a chain bracelet, smallrings passing through the holes at its four corners and serving toattach it to the larger links of the chain. On it the jeweller hasrepresented a gate with an arched doorway, flanked by towers, whichrise above the walls of the main building. Each tower is surmounted bya projecting upper structure, pierced with small circular loopholes,and both towers and walls are crowned with triangular battlements.The latter are obviously intended to be stepped, the engraver nothaving sufficient space to represent this detail in a design on sosmall a scale. The outline is probably that of a fortified city-gate,and it fully justifies the adoption of the stepped battlement in thereconstruction of military buildings of the period. Whether the templeswere furnished in the same manner, for purely decorative purposes, isnot so clear. Some idea of the appearance of one, restored on thisalternative hypothesis, may be gathered from the elevation of theunidentified temple known as "Z," which is given in Fig. 24.[Illustration: FIG. 23.GROUND-PLAN OF THE UNIDENTIFIED TEMPLE KNOWN AS "Z."A1: Main Court of temple.

Court. 16: Entrance-chamber to Inner Court. 17-21: Quarters forresident priesthood around Inner Court.(After Andrae.)]It is important that the ground-plans of no less than four of thetemples in Babylon have been recovered, for it will be seen thatthe main features, already noted in Ninmakh's temple, are alwaysrepeated.[141] In each the temple buildings are arranged around an opencourt, to which access is given through one or more entrances withvestibules. The doorways to temple and to shrine are flanked by groovedtowers, while within the shrine itself the cult-statue stood on a lowdais, visible from the court. Yet with this general similarity, allcombine special features of their own. The temple "Z," for example, isexactly rectangular in plan, and is divided into two distinct parts,the object of which may be readily surmised. The larger and easternportion, opening on the great court, was obviously devoted to theservice of the deity. For there, on the south side, is the shrine andits ante-chamber, with the dais for the eult-image against the southwall. The western portion is grouped around two smaller courts, and,as its arrangement resembles that of a private dwelling-house, we mayregard it as the quarters of the resident priesthood. Other notablefeatures are the three service-chambers to the shrine, and the threeseparate entrances to the temple itself, each with its own vestibuleand porters' room. But there is only one narrow passage, extendingpartly behind the shrine and containing, as suggested, a ramp orstairway to the roof. There was probably an altar before the northerngate, as shown in the restoration, but only the paved area on which itstood was found to be still in place.[Illustration: FIG. 24.CONJECTURAL RESTORATION OF THE UNIDENTIFIED TEMPLE KNOWN AS "Z."The view is taken from a point immediately opposite the north corner ofthe temple. The stepped battlements on walls and towers, borrowed frommilitary architecture, are here adopted in accordance with one theoryof reconstruction. (After Andrae and Koldewey.)]In the temples dedicated to Ishtar of Akkad and to the god Ninib theshrines are on the west side of the great court, instead of on thesouth as in those we have already examined. Thus it would seem therewas no special position for the shrine, though the temples themselvesare generally built with their corners directed approximately to thecardinal points.[142] In the temple of Ishtar unmistakable traces havebeen noted of a simple form of mural decoration that appears to havebeen employed in all the temples of Babylon. While the walls in generalwere coloured dead white with a thin gypsum wash, certain of the moreprominent parts, such as the main entrance, the doorway leading to theshrine and the niche behind the statue of the goddess, were washedover with black asphalt in solution, each blackened surface beingdecorated near its edge with white strips or line-borders. The contrastin colour presented by this black and white decoration must have beenstartling in its effect; no doubt, like the crude-brick material ofthe buildings, it was an inheritance from earlier times, and owed itsretention to its traditional religious significance.[Illustration: FIG. 25.GROUND-PLAN OF THE TEMPLE OF ISHTAR OF AKKAD.A: Open Court.

This we learn from Nabopolassar'sfoundation-cylinders, buried below the pavement of the shrine, whichrelate how the king erected the building in his honour, on an earlierfoundation, after he had kept back the foot of the Assyrian from theland of Akkad and had thrown off his heavy yoke.[143] It was fittingthat he should have marked his gratitude in this way to the god of war.[Illustration: FIG. 26.GROUND-PLAN OF THE TEMPLE OF NINIB.A: Open Court.

This was the famous E-sagila, a greatpart of which still lies buried some twenty-one metres below thesurface of Tell 'Amrân.[144] Its main portion, lying to the west,is practically square in ground-plan, and like the smaller templesof the city, it consists of chambers grouped around an open court;but their arrangement here is far more symmetrical.[145] There wasa great gateway in the centre of each side, where in Neriglissar'stime stood the eight bronze serpents, a pair of them beside eachentrance.[146] The eastern gate was no doubt the principal one, as itgives access to the inner court through a single great vestibule orentrance-chamber, in striking contrast to the smaller vestibules onthe north and south sides, from which the court can be reached onlythrough side-corridors.[147] Around the great court within, the templedoorways and towers are arranged symmetrically. The shrine of Marduklay on its western side, as may be inferred from the façade and toweredentrance. This was the E-kua of the inscriptions, which Nebuchadnezzarstates he made to shine like the sun, coating its walls with gold asthough with gypsum-plaster, a phrase which recalls the mud and gypsumwashes of the other temples. "The best of my cedars," he says, "that Ibrought from Lebanon, the noble forest, I sought out for the roofingof Ekua, [Marduk's] lordly chamber; the mighty cedars I covered withgleaming gold for the roofing of Ekua."[148] The lavish employment ofgold in the temple's decoration is attested by Herodotus, who statesthat in this, "the lower temple,"[149] was a great seated figure ofZeus, which, like the throne, the dais, and the table before it,was fashioned of gold, the metal weighing altogether eight hundredtalents.[150][Illustration: VI. Two views of the Temple of Ninib in course ofexcavation.]The identification of the temple was rendered certain by the discoveryof inscribed bricks in earlier pavements below those of Nebuchadnezzar.Inscriptions stamped upon bricks from two pavements of Ashur-bani-palrecord that this Assyrian king made "bricks of E-sagila andE-temen-anki," while on an older one which he re-used, stamped with thename of Esarhaddon, it is definitely stated that it formed part of thepaving of E-sagila.[151] These pavements were reached by means of anopen excavation in Tell 'Amrân, extending some forty metres each way.It took no less than eight months to remove the soil to the pavementlevel, and it is estimated that some thirty thousand cubic metres ofearth were carted away in the course of the work. It is not surprising,therefore, that the chambers on the west side of the court, includingthe shrine of Marduk, still remain covered by the mound. A subsidiaryshrine, on the north side of the court, has been cleared, and it wouldbe a spot of considerable interest if, as Dr. Koldewey suggests, itwas dedicated to Ea. For in the Hellenistic period Ea was identifiedwith Serapis, and should this prove to have been his sanctuary, itwas here that Alexander's generals repaired during his illness, whenthey enquired of the god whether he should be carried thither to behealed.[152]To the north of Marduk's temple rose its ziggurat, the Tower of Babel,known to Babylonians of all ages as E-temen-anki, "The House of theFoundation-stone of Heaven and Earth." It stood within its Peribolosor sacred precincts, marked now by the flat area or plain which thelocal Arabs call Sakhn, "the pan."[153] The precincts of the tower weresurrounded by an enclosing wall, decorated with innumerable groovedtowers, along the east and south sides of which the track of the SacredWay may still be followed.[154] On the inner side of the wall, in itswhole circuit, stretched a vast extent of buildings, all devoted to thecult of the city-god, and forming, in the phrase of their discoverer,a veritable Vatican of Babylon.[155][Illustration: FIG. 27.GROUND-PLAN OF E-TEMEN-ANKI AND E-SAGILA.A: Sacred Way, or Procession Street.

Withinthe largest of the great courts[156] stood the temple-tower,[157]its core constructed of unburnt brick but enclosed with a burntbrick facing.[158] In the reconstruction a single stairway is shownprojecting from the southern side, and giving access to the first stageor story of the tower. But it has lately been ascertained that threeseparate stairways ascended the tower on the south side, the two outerones being built against its south-east and south-west corners, andbeing flanked on their outer sides by stepped walls, which formed asolid breastwork or protection for any one ascending them.[159][Illustration: FIG. 28.CONJECTURAL RECONSTRUCTION OF E-TEMEN-ANKI AND E-SAGILA.The form of the Temple-tower within the Peribolos is here restored inaccordance with Dr. Koldewey's theory that it consisted of a singlestage or story, on which the upper Temple of Marduk rested. Accordingto an alternative interpretation of Herodotus, the upper Temple wouldhave formed the last of eight receding towers or stages. It will benoted that the two flanking stairways, recently discovered on the southside of the tower, are here not shown.(After Andrae.)]The buildings within the precincts were evidently not temples, as theypresent none of their characteristic features, such as the shrineor the towered façade, and any theory as to their use must be basedon pure conjecture. Judging solely by their ground-plans, it wouldappear that the two great buildings on the east side,[160] consistingof a long series of narrow chambers ranged around open courts, wereprobably the magazines and store-chambers. The buildings on the southside resemble dwelling-houses, and were probably the quarters of thepriesthood; their huge size would not have been out of keeping with theprivileges and dignified position enjoyed by those in control of theprincipal temple in the capital. The small chambers along the walls ofthe Northern Court,[161] and the narrow Western Court,[162] may wellhave been used to house the thousands of pilgrims who doubtless flockedto Babylon to worship at the central shrine. No less than twelvegateways led into the sacred precincts, the principal entrance being onthe east side,[163] exactly opposite the east face of the temple-tower.The breccia paving of the Sacred Way was here continued within the areaof the precincts, along the centre of the open space, or deep recess,between the temple-magazines. The great gateway probably spanned thewestern end of this recess, thus completing the line of the Main Courtupon that side.[164]The most striking feature of E-temen-anki was naturally thetemple-tower itself, which rose high above the surrounding buildingsand must have been visible from all parts of the city and from someconsiderable distance beyond the walls. Its exact form has been thesubject of some controversy. Dr. Koldewey rejects the current view,based upon the description of Herodotus,[165] that it consisted of astepped tower in eight stages, with the ascent to the top encirclingthe outside. It is true that the excavations have shown that theascent to the first stage, at any rate, was not of this character,consisting, as it did, of a triple stairway built against one side ofthe tower;[166] but, as the ground-plan only of the building can now betraced, there is nothing to indicate the form of its upper structure.Dr. Koldewey does not regard the evidence for the existence of steppedtowers in Babylonia as satisfactory, and he appears to consider thatthey depend solely on the description of Herodotus, who, he claims,says nothing about stepped terraces, nor that each stage was smallerthan the one below it. He is inclined to reconstruct the tower as builtin a single stage, decorated on its face with coloured bands, andsurmounted by the temple to which the triple-stairway would have givendirect access. This view of its reconstruction is shown in Fig. 28,but its author considers the problem as still unsettled, and suspendshis judgment until the Ziggurat at Borsippa, the best preserved of thetemple-towers, is excavated.There, as at Babylon, we have a temple and a separate temple-tower,but they both stood within the same peribolos or sacred enclosure,along the inner side of which were built series of numerous smallchambers resembling those of E-temen-anki. A street[167] ran along thenorth-west front of the peribolos, and two gateways[168] opened onto it from the sacred enclosure. The main entrance both to peribolosand temple was probably on the north-east side.[169] It will be notedthat the plan of the temple[170] follows the lines of those alreadydescribed, consisting of a complex of buildings ranged around onegreat court and a number of smaller ones. The shrine of the god Nabûstood on the south-west side of the Great Court, the heavily-toweredfaçade indicating the entrance to its outer vestibule. While somuch of the temple itself and of its enclosure has been cleared,the temple-tower[171] awaits excavation. It still rises to a heightof no less than forty-seven metres above the surrounding plain, butsuch a mass of _débris_ has fallen about its base that to clear itcompletely would entail a vast amount of labour. The mound of soilnot only covers the open court surrounding the temple-tower, butextends over the inner line of chambers on the north-west side of theperibolos. The destruction of the temple and its surroundings by firehas vitrified the upper structure of the ziggurat, and to this fact theruins owe their preservation. For the bricks are welded into a solidmass, and, since it is no longer possible to separate them, they offerno attractions as building-material and so have escaped the fate ofE-temen-anki.[Illustration: FIG. 29.GROUND-PLAN OF E-ZIDA AND THE TEMPLE-TOWER OF NABÛ AT BORSIPPA.A: The temple E-zida.

F: Chambers onsouth-west side of Peribolos. G, G: Street running along the north-westface of the Peribolos.(After Koldewey.)]It is quite possible that, when Nabû's temple-tower is excavated,it will throw some light upon the upper structure of these massivebuildings. Meanwhile we possess a piece of evidence which should notbe ignored in any discussion of the subject. On a boundary-stone ofthe time of Merodach-baladan I. are carved a number of emblems ofthe gods, including those of Marduk and Nabii, which are set besideeach other in the second row. That of Marduk consists of his sacredSpear-head supported by his dragon, that of Nabfi being the Wedge orStilus, also supported by a horned dragon. But while the other emblemsare left sculptured in relief against the field of the stone, that ofNabii is engraved against a temple-tower.[172] It will be noticed thatthis rises in stages, diminishing in size and set one above the other.The rough engraving may well represent the outward form of Nabû'stemple-tower at Borsippa at the time of Merodach-baladan I. In anycase, since the emblems on the boundary-stones are associated withtemples, the only building it can be intended for is a temple-tower. Itthus definitely proves the construction of this class of building instories or stages, which diminish in area as they ascend.[Illustration: FIG. 30.ROUGH ENGRAVING OF A TEMPLE-TOWER UPON A BOUNDARY-STONE.The boundary-stone is of the period of Marduk-aplu-iddina, orMerodach-baladan I. The engraving represents a temple-tower, beforewhich is a diagon supporting on its back an upright Wedge, the emblemof Nabû. The tower is represented as built in stories, or stoppedstages, set one upon the other. (From Brit. Mus., No. 90850.)]Additional evidence that this was actually the form of the Tower ofBabylon has been deduced from a tablet, drawn up in the Seleucid era,and purporting to give a detailed description and measurements ofE-sagila and its temple-tower. A hurried description of the text andits contents was published by George Smith[173] before he started onhis last journey to the east, and from that time the tablet was lostsight of. But some three years ago it was found in Paris, and it hasnow been made fully available for study.[174] It must be admitted thatit is almost impossible at present to reconcile the descriptions onthe tablet with the actual remains of E-sagila and the Peribolos thathave been recovered by excavation. The "Great Terrace (or Court)," andthe "Terrace (or Court) of Ishtar and Zamama," which, according tothe tablet, were the largest and most important subdivisions in thesacred area, have not been satisfactorily identified. Dr. Koldewey wasinclined to regard the former as corresponding to the Great Court[175]of the Peribolos, including the buildings surrounding it, and thelatter he would identify with the northern court of the enclosure;[176]while the third great sub-division he suggested might be the innerspace of the Great Court, which he thus had to count twice over.Scarcely more satisfactory is M. Marcel Dieulafoy's reconstruction,since he makes the two main areas, or "terraces," extend to the eastof the Sacred Way, over ground which, as the excavations have shown,was covered by the houses of the town, and thus lay beyond the limitsof the sacred area. It is possible that the apparent discrepancies maybe traced to an extensive reconstruction of the Peribolos between theNeo-Babylonian and the Seleucid periods. But, whatever explanationbe adopted, a number of detailed measurements given by the tablet arebest explained on the hypothesis that they refer to receding stages ofa temple-tower. The tablet may thus be cited as affording additionalsupport to the current conception of the Tower of Babylon, and there isno reason to reject the interpretation that has so long been acceptedof the famous description of the tower that is given by Herodotus.[177]There is one other structure in Babylon that deserves mention, and thatis the bridge over the Euphrates, since its remains are those of theearliest permanent bridge of which we have any record in antiquity.It will be noted from the ground-plan of E-temen-anki[178] that theprocession-street leads past the corner of the Peribolos to a greatgate-way in the river-wall, guarding the head of the bridge whichcrossed the Euphrates on stone piers. The river at this point appearsto have been one hundred and twenty-three metres in breadth. The piersare built in the shape of boats with their bows pointing up-stream,and their form was no doubt suggested by the earlier bridge-of-boatswhich they displaced. The roadway, as in boat-bridges in Mesopotamiaat the present day, was laid across the boatpiers, and must have beenvery much narrower than the length of the piers themselves. The bridge,which is mentioned by Herodotus[179] and Diodorus,[180] was the workof Nabopolassar, as we learn from the East India House Inscription, inwhich Nebuchadnezzar states that his father "had built piers of burntbrick for the crossing of the Euphrates."[181] The stone used in itsconstruction, which is referred to by Herodotus, was no doubt laidabove the brick-piers, as a foundation for the flat wooden structureof the bridge itself. The later river-wall was the work of Nabonidusand it marks an extension of the bank westwards, which was renderedpossible by the building of Nebuchadnezzar's fortification in thebed of the river to the west of the Southern Citadel.[182] The oldline of the left bank is marked by the ruins of earlier river-walls,traces of which have been uncovered below the north-west angle of thePeribolos.[183] It was doubtless to protect the Peribolos and E-sagilafrom flood that the bank was extended in this way.The buildings that have hitherto been described all date from the laterAssyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods, and during their first years ofwork at Babylon the excavators found nothing that could be assignedto the earlier epochs in the history of the capital. It was assumedthat the destruction of Babylon by Sennacherib had been so thoroughthat very little of the earlier city had survived. But later on it wasrealized that the remains of the older Babylon lay largely below thepresent water-level. The continual deposit of silt in the bed of theriver has raised the level at which water is reached when digging onthe site of the city, and it is clear that at the time of the FirstDynasty the general level of the town was considerably lower than inlater periods. During recent years a comparatively small body of waterhas flowed along the Euphrates bed, so that it has been possible on theMerkes Mound to uncover one quarter in the ancient city. There trencheshave been cut to a depth of twelve metres, when water-level was reachedand further progress was rendered impossible, although the remains ofbuildings continued still lower.[Illustration: FIG. 31.PLAN OF THE MERKES MOUND, SHOWING PART OF THE STREET NET-WORK OFBABYLON.A: The Sacred Way or Procession-Street of Babylon. B: E-makh, thetemple of the goddess Ninmakh. C: South-east corner of the SouthernCitadel with the Palace of Nebuchadnezzar. D: Canal and basin. E:Northern Court of the Peribolos of E-temen-anki. P: Main Court of thePeribolos. G: The mound Merkes. H: Temple of Ishtar of Akkad. J: GreekTheatre. K: Old canal.(After Koldewey.)]From the accompanying plan it will be seen that the street net-work hasbeen recovered over a considerable area. The entire structure of themound consists of the dwellings of private citizens, rising layer abovelayer from below water-level to the surface of the soil. The upperstrata date from the Parthian period, and here the houses are scatteredwith wide spaces of garden or waste land between them. In strikingcontrast to these scanty remains are the streets of the Greek, Persianand Neo-Babylonian periods, where the houses are crowded together, andopen spaces, which were at one time courts or gardens, have lateron been surrendered to the builder. We here have striking proof ofthe value of house-property in Babylon during the city's period ofgreatest prosperity. Still deeper in the mound a level can be datedto the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, for in the houses were foundtablets inscribed in the reigns of Merodach-baladan I., Meli-ShipakII., and Enlil-nadin-shum. In the northern part of the mound, inthe lowest stratum of all and lying partly above and partly belowwater-level, contract-tablets of the First Dynasty were uncovered,bearing date-formulæ of Samsu-iluna, Ammi-ditana and Samsu-ditana.Here the mud-brick walls of the houses, though not very thick, allrest upon burnt-brick foundations, a method of building which, as wehave seen,[184] survived into the Neo-Babylonian period. This is theearliest city of which traces have been recovered, and a thick layerof ashes testifies to its destruction by fire. There can be no doubtthat the town so destroyed was that of Hammurabi and his immediatesuccessors, for the dated tablets were found lying in the layer ofashes undisturbed. We here have additional proof that Babylon's FirstDynasty ended in disaster. It is possible that the conflagration, inwhich the city then perished, was the work of the Hittite raiders whoseonslaught we know took place in Samsu-ditana's reign.This portion of the town would appear to have been entirelyresidential, as it contains no open space such as would have servedas a market. Even the temples were without a space in front of them,and in this respect resemble the churches in many modern cities. Itwill be noted that the temple of Ishtar of Akkad in the north of theMerkes Mound, though not actually built in, is approached on everyside by private houses, though on its southern face the road is ratherbroader than elsewhere. Still more shut in were the temple of Ninib andthe unidentified temple known as "Z," both of which lie in the moundIshin-aswad.[185] Here trenches cut across the mound have uncovered theruins of Babylonian houses in crude brick, the remains of differentperiods lying one above the other as in Merkes, and they surroundthe temples on all sides. The only other spot in Babylon where thesame strata of streets and private houses have been found is in a lowrange of mounds between the Ḳaṣr and Tell 'Amrân, where the dwellingsappear to be of an inferior character such as we might expect in apoorer quarter of the town. It is only in the rather higher groundthat satisfactory results have yet been obtained, as in the plain theearlier strata descend below water-level. It is possible that furtherdigging may lay bare the business-quarters of ancient Babylon, and thatwe may identify the markets and bazaars which formed one of the greatcentres of distribution in the ancient world.Meanwhile, the Merkes Mound has yielded sufficient evidence to form ageneral conclusion as to the lines on which the city was built. Thestreet net-work shown in the plan is mainly that of the Neo-Babylonianperiod, but, wherever the earlier levels were preserved, it wasnoted that the old streets followed the same lines with but slightvariations. The main arteries run roughly north and south, parallelto the course of the Sacred Way, while others cross them at rightangles.[186] It would appear that, in spite of the absence of openspaces, we here have a deliberate attempt at town-planning on ascientific basis, the original idea of which may be traced back to theFirst Dynasty. It is true that the streets are not entirely regular,but the main thoroughfares all run through, and the island-plots areall approximately rectangular. We may probably place this achievementto the credit of the Semitic element in the population, as in the twoSumerian towns, in which private house-property has been uncovered,there is no trace of town-planning. Both at Fâra and at Abû Hatab,the sites of the early Sumerian cities of Shuruppak and Kisurra, thestreets that have been followed out are crooked and far more irregularthan those of Babylon. It has long been known that Hammurabi did muchto codify the laws of his country and render their administrationeffective. It would now appear that similar system and method wereintroduced at the same period into the more material side of thenational life.The excavations at Babylon have thus thrown some direct light uponthe condition of the city during the period at which it first becamethe capital. It is true that no portion of a royal or sacred buildingas yet identified antedates the later Assyrian Empire, and that, asthe result of extensive reconstruction, the ruins of temples, palacesand city-walls are mainly those of the Neo-Babylonian period. Butthere was no great break in continuity between that epoch and itspredecessors, so that, when due allowance has been made for certaininnovations, the buildings of the later period may be treated astypical of Babylonian civilization as a whole. We have seen how thestreets of Babylon followed the same lines throughout the whole ofher dynastic period, and a similar spirit of conservatism no doubtcharacterized her architectural development. Temples were rebuilt againand again on the old sites, and even in the Neo-Babylonian period theyretained the mud-brick walls and primitive decoration of their remotepredecessors. Indeed, the conditions of life in Babylonia precludedany possibility of drastic change. The increased use of burnt brickin the upper structure of the royal palaces rendered possible thebrilliant enamelling of the Neo-Babylonian craftsmen. But, even aslate as Nabopolassar's reign, the thick mud-brick walls of the king'sdwelling must have resembled those of Hammurabi himself: it was mainlyin point of size that the earlier palace and city differed from thoseof later monarchs. And when we examine the successive periods of thecountry's history, we shall find that tradition exerted an equallypowerful influence in retaining unaltered the essential features of thenational life. It was under her earliest dynasty that Babylon workedout in detail a social organization that suited her agricultural andcommercial activities; and it is a remarkable tribute to its foundersthat it should have survived the shock of foreign domination and haveimposed its mould upon later generations.[Footnote 1: Rogers points out that the rabbi's account of Babylonseems to lack the little touches which betray the record of aneye-witness, and he compares it with the same traveller's descriptionsof Mosul and Baghdad. By far the best and fullest account of the earlyexplorers of Babylonia is that given by Rogers in his "History ofBabylonia and Assyria," Vol. 1., pp. 84 ff.][Footnote 2: See Hakluyt, "The Principall navigations voiages anddiscoveries of the English nation," ed. 1589, p. 232; ed. Goldsmid,Vol. X., "Asia," Pt. III. (1889), p. 63.][Footnote 3: He states that "the heavenly fire which struck the towersplit it to its very foundation," a description which is thoroughlyapplicable to the present appearance of Borsippa's temple-tower atEl-Birs; see the photograph reproduced on Plate II. Other travellers,such as Anthony Shirley in 1599 or 1600, appear to have made the sameidentification. A few years later Pietro della Valle was nearer themark in identifying the tower with the mound Babil, from which hecarried away to Home some of Nebuchadnezzar's stamped bricks, probablythe first collection of Babylonian antiquities to reach Europe (cf.Rogers, _op. cit.,_ p. 98).][Footnote 4: See p. 10, Fig. 2.][Footnote 5: In addition to his incomplete plan (cf. C. J. Rich,"Narrative of a Journey to the site of Babylon in 1811," edited byhis widow, London, 1839; opposite p. 43), and the smaller-scale planof Major Rennet based upon it (published originally in "Archæologia,"Vol. 18, and reprinted with Rich's memoir), we possess anothersketch-plan, more accurate in certain details, by Sir Robert Ker Porter(cf. "Travels in Georgia, Persia, Armenia, Ancient Babylonia, etc.,during the years 1817, 1818, 1819, and 1820," Vol II., 1822, oppositep. 349). Accurate surveys of large districts in Babylonia were madeby Captain J. Felix Jones of the Indian Navy, who did such excellentwork on Nineveh and its neighbourhood (see his "Memoirs," issued as avolume in "Bombay Government Records," No. XLIII., New Series, Bombay,1857; and for the Nineveh survey, cf. "Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc.," Vol.XV., 1853, pp. 352 ff.). The material collected by Felix Jones inBabylonia, was incorporated in the India Office Map, which was compiledby Trelawney Saunders on the basis of the surveys made between 1860 and1865 by Commander W. Beaumont Selby, Lieut. W. Collingwood and Lieut.J. B. Bewsher, all of the Indian Navy. This was issued in 1885 underthe title "Surveys of Ancient Babylon and the surrounding ruins withpart of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, the Hindiyeh Canal, the Seaof Nejf and the Shat Atshar," etc., London, 1885. It takes in the areafrom Baghdad to the junction of the Shatt Atshar with the Euphrates andis by far the best map, and the only one on a large scale, hithertoproduced of Babylon and its neighbourhood. All plans of the moundscovering the ruins of the city itself are of course superseded by thoseissued by the German expedition.][Footnote 6: See "Nineveh and Babylon," London, 1853.][Footnote 7: The results of the expedition were published in twovolumes under the title "Expédition scientifique en Mésopotamie,"Paris, 1863.][Footnote 8: Cf. "Asshur and the Land of Nimrod," New York, 1897.][Footnote 9: "Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft zuBerlin," Nos. 1-54 (March, 1899--June, 1914).][Footnote 10: See Koldewey, "Die Tempel von Babylon und Borsippa,"Leipzig, 1911.][Footnote 11: Cf. "Das wieder erstehende Babylon," Leipzig, 1912. Acareful English translation of the work, from the pen of Mrs. Johns,has been issued under the title "The Excavations at Babylon," London,1914.][Footnote 12: Recent discoveries at Shergât prove that a Sumerianoccupation of the site of Ashur preceded the first settlement of theSemitic Assyrians. In a stratum below the first Ishtar-temple (theearliest Assyrian temple yet recovered, dating as it does from theclose of the third millennium B.C.), several examples of Sumeriansculpture were found which bear an unmistakably close relationshipto the earliest Sumerian work at Tello and Bismâya. The racial typerepresented by the sculptures is also that of the south, and suggestsa Sumerian occupation of Assyria before the advent of the Semites. Thetermination of their settlement at Ashur was probably not the work ofthe Semitic conquerors of Assyria, but of another non-Semitic raceakin to the Mitannian people of Northern Mesopotamia (on this subjectsee further Chap. IV., pp. 137 ff.). But the Semites were at leastindirect heirs of the Sumerian inhabitants and derived their culturein part from them; and the growth of such elements in their acquiredcivilization would have been fostered as intercourse with the southincreased. For a summary account of the new discoveries at Ashur, seethe "Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft," No. 54 (June,1914).][Footnote 13: See further, p. 72 f.][Footnote 14: I., 178.][Footnote 15: For references to other estimates, see How and Wells,"Commentary on Herodotus," _sub I._, 178.][Footnote 16: Cf.

Haverfield, "Ancient Town Planning," p. 22.][Footnote 18: See above, p. 10, Fig. 2.][Footnote 19: See the general plan of Babylon on p. 23, Fig. 3, B.][Footnote 20: Fig. 3, T.][Footnote 21: A. D. and E. on plan.][Footnote 22: Some traces of walls still remain near the village ofSinjar (see Fig. 3, 4), and Weissbach has attempted to use them fora reconstruction of the city plan. As a result he makes the westernportion of the city considerably smaller than that on the eastern bank,his north-west wall meeting the Euphrates opposite the Ḳaṣr, andbeing continued by the elaborate fortification-walls to the north ofthe Southern Citadel; cf. "Das Stadtbild von Babylon," in "Der alteOrient," V., Heft 4. This represents quite a possible arrangement.We shall see that these remains of western walls may possibly datefrom a still earlier period, and may also have defended the westernextension of the earlier city-area (see below, p. 35). But even sothey may have remained the only fortifications on the western bank;for the tendency to expansion would have been more marked to the eastwhere the main citadel offered increased possibilities of defence.The fact that Nebuchadnezzar's northern citadel should also have beenbuilt on the left bank points in the same direction. But the questioncan only be settled definitely when the traces of these western wallshave been examined by excavation and their relationship to the easternfortifications determined.][Footnote 23: The line of mounds now marking in places the position ofthe city-wall is formed, oddly enough, by the core of the mud-brickportion, which still stands above the level of the surrounding soil.The far stronger outer wall has completely disappeared, for its fineburnt-bricks have tempted plunderers in search of building material. Itis only after excavation that the lower courses of its foundation aredetected when still in place. It is possible that deep excavation maysettle the position of the whole line of walls, even where no trace ofthem now remains upon the surface.][Footnote 24: This has been deduced from the fact that a ditch, ormoat, once ran immediately in front of it, of which traces onlyhave been found. The old ditch was filled in when Nebuchadnezzar'sburnt-brick wall broadened and strengthened the whole line offortification.][Footnote 25: It has been reckoned that there were not less than ninetytowers along the north-east wall of the city, though only fifteen ofthese have as yet been completely excavated.][Footnote 26: I., 179.][Footnote 27: Cf. Koldewey, "Babylon," p. 2.][Footnote 28: He tells us that in the circuit of the wall there were ahundred gates, all of brass, with brazen lintels and side-posts; cf.I., 179. As yet the excavations have not determined the site of anyof the gates in the outer wall; but the manner in which bronze mayhave been used to strengthen and decorate the doors and gateways isillustrated by the bronze lintel, or step, from E-zida, the temple ofNabû at Borsippa, now in the British Museum: cf. Plate XXVI., oppositep. 278, and see further, p. 77, n. 4.][Footnote 29: See Fig. 3, A.][Footnote 30: Indeed during the Neo-Babylonian period it appearsto have been known as "the City of the Dwelling" of "the King ofBabylon;" see further, p. 41.][Footnote 31: Cf.

Traces of a very ancientsettlement, with much pottery (still unpublished), have been foundby deep trenching in the fillings below the south-east cornerof the citadel; cf. Koldewey, "Babylon," p. 82.

The walls are distinguished,by cross-hatching, from the structure of the palace which is ofburnt-brick. When the Ishtar Gate (H) was built by Nebuchadnezzar,the northern of the two walls received a facing on both sides ofbrick-rubble laid in mud and bitumen, indicated by a heavy surroundingline upon the plan; but originally this wall too was of crude brick.][Footnote 38: Fig. 6, V; and see further, p. 58, n. 1.][Footnote 39: The present crude brick walls of the Ḳaṣr fortificationsdate from his reign or from that of his father.][Footnote 40: The meaning of _nimitti_ is not quite certain.][Footnote 41: In 648 B.C.; see further, Chap.

VIII.][Footnote 45: Cf. Delitzsch's translation in Koldewey, "Babylon," p.139; Engl. ed. p. 138.

In earlier periods it may have been simply a canal, which ledoff from the river at this point.][Footnote 55: See above, p. 28.][Footnote 56: See above, p. 30, Fig. 6, N.][Footnote 57: On a foundation-cylinder from Sippar in the BritishMuseum (No. 91114; A.

Itsfoundation I laid in the abyss, and its head I raised mountain-high";cf. Ball, "Troc. Soc. Bibl. Arch.", X., May 1888, Pl.

It re-entered the river close under thecitadel-wall, for its outlet has been found in the later river-wallof Nabonidus. It was perhaps the canal called in the inscriptionsLibil-khegalla, "May it bring abundance." It will be seen from theplan that the remains of the canal to the south-east show a narrowchannel (P), less than three metres in breadth, but widening westwardof the Sacred Road (G) into a broad basin (R). This represents areconstruction, probably of the time of Neriglissar, who built a bridgefor the road across the canal. Formerly the road crossed the canal by adam with walled embankments, of which traces have been found below thecanal-walls. Beneath the embankment the water probably flowed throughgrated sluices like these spanning Nebuchadnezzar's narrow channelbetween his river-fortification and the citadel.][Footnote 60: See above, p. 30, and cf.

Onthe other hand, after the discovery of the Nippur Kings' List, it waspossible to establish the succession of the earlier dynasties of Urand Nîsin, and to conjecture their relation to the still more remoterulers of Akkad and other cities in the north and south. The two halvesof the skeleton were each articulated satisfactorily enough, but thefew bones were wanting which should enable us to fit them together. Itis scarcely necessary to say that there was no lack of theories forfilling in the gap. But every one of the schemes suggested introducedfresh difficulties of its own; and to writers of a more cautioustemperament it seemed preferable to avoid a detailed chronology forthose earlier ages. Approximate dates only were suggested, for, inspite of the obvious temptations presented by the Nippur List, it wasrealized that any attempt to work out the earlier dates in detailwas bound to be misleading. Such writers were content to await therecovery of new material and meanwhile to think in periods.[1]It is thus with some satisfaction that the announcement may be madethat the connecting link, for which we have been waiting, has quiterecently been established, with the result that we have now in ourhands the necessary material for reconstructing the chronology on asound basis and extending it back without a serious break, into themiddle of the third millennium. The effect of the newly recovered pointof contact between the earlier and the later phases in the country'shistory is naturally of greater importance for the former, so far asstrict chronology is concerned.[2] But the information afforded, as tothe overlapping of additional dynasties with that of the West-Semitickings of Babylon, throws an entirely new light upon the circumstanceswhich led to the rise of Babylon to power. Our picture of the capital'searly history, as an independent city-state struggling for the masteryof her rivals, ceases to be an abstraction, and we may now followher varying fortunes to their climax in Hammurabi's reign. This willform the subject of the following chapter; but, as the new historicalmaterial is only now in course of publication, it will be advisablefirst to give some account of it and to estimate its effects upon thechronological scheme.It has long been recognized that certain kings of Larsa, the cityin Southern Babylonia now marked by the mounds of Senkera, werecontemporaneous with the First Dynasty of Babylon. The greatest ofthese, Rîm-Sin, a ruler of Elamite extraction, was the contemporary ofHammurabi, and his signal defeat by Babylon was commemorated in thedate-formula for the thirty-first year of the latter's reign.[3] Thisvictory was, indeed, the chief event of Hammurabi's reign, and at onetime it was thought that it freed Babylon once for all from her mostpowerful enemy. But the discovery of a chronicle of early Babyloniankings, while substantiating the fact of Hammurabi's victory, andaffording the additional information that it was followed by thecapture of Ur and Larsa, proved that Rîm-Sin survived into the reignof Samsu-iluna, Hammurabi's son, by whom he was finally defeated.[4]Another king of Larsa, Warad-Sin, formerly identified with Rîm-Sin, wascorrectly recognized as his brother, both of them sons of the ElamiteKudur-Mabuk, and successively kings of the city.[5] The names of otherrulers were known from votive texts and foundation-records, and fromthis source it was possible to incorporate in the dynasty Gungunum,probably Sumu-ilum (a king of Ur), and Nûr-Adad or Nûr-Immer and hisson Sin-idinnam. It was realized that Sin-idinnam, the correspondent towhom Hammurabi addressed his letters, was not to be identified with theking of Larsa of that name,[6] and all four rulers were provisionallyregarded as having preceded Warad-Sin upon the throne.[7]A complete list of the Larsa kings has now been recovered by ProfessorA. T. Clay of Yale University, who is engaged in preparing the text forpublication. The dynasty is seen to have consisted of sixteen kings,and against the name of each ruler is stated the number of years heoccupied the throne. The surface of the tablet is damaged in places andthe figures against three of the names are wanting. But this is of nogreat consequence, since the scribe has added up the total number ofyears enumerated in the list, and states it at the close as two hundredand eighty-nine.[8] A most important point about the list is thatthe last two kings of the dynasty are stated to have been Hammurabiand Samsu-iluna, who, as we know, were the sixth and seventh rulersof the First Dynasty of Babylon. It is true that Hammurabi is one ofthe three kings against whose names the figures are wanting. But wealready know that he conquered Larsa in his thirty-first year,[9] sothat we may confidently regard him as king of that city for the lasttwelve years of his reign. The two remaining kings of the dynasty whoseyears are missing, Sin-idinnam and Sin-iḳisham, have thirteen yearsto divide between them, and since they are only separated from eachother by the short two-years' reign of Sin-iribam, the absence of thefigures is practically immaterial. We are thus furnished with the meansfor establishing in detail the relationship of the earliest kings ofBabylon to those of Larsa.[Illustration: VII. Brick of Sin-idinnam, King of Larsa, recording thecutting of a canal and the restoration of the Temple of the Moon-god inthe city of Ur]But like most new discoveries, this one has brought a fresh problemin its train. We already suspected that Rîm-Sin was a long-livedmonarch, and we here find him credited with a reign of sixty-one years.But that fact would be difficult to reconcile with his survival intoSamsu-iluna's tenth year, which, according to the figures of the newlist, would have fallen eighty-three years after his accession tothe throne. That Rîm-Sin did survive into the reign of Samsu-ilunaseems practically certain, since the broken passage in the latechronicle, from which the fact was at first inferred, is supportedby two date-formulæ which can be satisfactorily explained only onthat hypothesis.[10] Thus, if he ascended the throne of Larsa whenmerely a boy of fifteen, we should have to infer from the new figuresthat he was leading a revolt against Samsu-iluna in his ninety-eighthyear--a combination of circumstances which is just within the boundsof possibility, but is hardly probable or convincing. We shall seepresently that there is a comparatively simple, and not improbable,solution of the puzzle, to which another line of evidence seems toconverge.It will be noted that the new list of the kings of Larsa, importantas it undoubtedly is for the history of its own period, does not initself supply the long-desired link between the earlier and the laterchronology of Babylonia. The relationship of the First Dynasty ofBabylon with that of Nîsin[11] is, so far as the new list is concerned,left in the same state of uncertainty as before. The possibility haslong been foreseen that the Dynasty of Nîsin and the First Dynasty ofBabylon overlapped each other,[12] as was proved to have been the casewith the first dynasties in the Babylonian List of Kings, and as wasconfidently assumed with regard to the dynasties of Larsa and Babylon.That no long interval separated the two dynasties from one anotherhad been inferred from the character of the contract-tablets, datingfrom the period of the Nîsin Dynasty, which had been found at Nippur;for these were seen to bear a elose resemblance to those of the FirstBabylonian Dynasty in form, material, writing, and terminology.[13]There were obvious advantages to be obtained, if grounds could beproduced for believing that the two dynasties were not only closelyconsecutive but were partly contemporaneous. For, in such a case, itwould follow that not only the earlier kings of Babylon, but also thekings of Larsa, would have been reigning at the same time as the laterkings of Nîsin. In fact, we should picture Babylonia as still dividedinto a number of smaller principalities, each vying with the other ina contest for the hegemony and maintaining a comparatively independentrule within its own borders. It was fully recognized that such acondition of affairs would amply account for the confusion in the latersuccession at Nîsin, and our scanty knowledge of that period could thenbe combined with the fuller sources of information on the First Dynastyof Babylon.[14]In the absence of any definite synchronism, such as we alreadypossessed for deciding the inter-relations of the early Babyloniandynasties, other means were tried in order to establish a pointof contact. The capture of Nîsin by Rîm-Sin, which is recorded indate-formulæ upon tablets found at Tell Sifr and Nippur, was evidentlylooked upon as an event of considerable importance, since it formed anepoch for dating tablets in that district. It was thus a legitimateassumption that the capture of the city by Rîm-Sin should be regardedas having brought the Dynasty of Nîsin to an end; such an assumptioncertainly supplied an adequate reason for the rise of a new era intime-reckoning. Now in the date-formulæ of the First Dynasty of Babylontwo captures of the city of Nîsin are commemorated, the earlier one inthat for the seventeenth year of Sin-muballit, the later in the formulafor Hammurabi's seventh year. Advocates have been found for derivingeach of these dates from the capture of Nîsin by Rîm-Sin, and soobtaining the desired point of contact.[15] But the obvious objectionto either of these views is that we should hardly expect a victory byRîm-Sin to be commemorated in the date-formulæ of his chief rival;and certain attempts to show that Babylon was at the time the vassalof Larsa have not proved very convincing. Moreover, if we accept theearlier identification, it raises the fresh difficulty that the eraof Nîsin was not disturbed by Hammurabi's conquest of that city. Therejection of both views thus leads to the same condition of uncertaintyfrom which we started.A fresh and sounder line of research has recently been opened up. Adetailed study has been undertaken of the proper names occurring oncontract-tablets from Nippur, and it was remarked that some of theproper names found in documents belonging to the Nîsin and LarsaDynasties are identical with those appearing on other Nippur tabletsbelonging to the First Dynasty of Babylon.[16] That they were borneby the same individuals is in many eases quite certain from the factthat the names of their fathers are also given. Both sets of documentswere not only found at Nippur but were obviously written there,since they closely resemble one another in general appearance, styleand arrangement. The same witnesses, too, occur again and again onthem, and some of the tablets, which were drawn up under differentdynasties, are the work of the same scribe. It has even been foundpossible, by the study of the proper names, to follow the history ofa family through three generations, during which it was living atNippur under different rulers belonging to the dynasties of Nîsin,Larsa and Babylon; and one branch of the family can never have leftthe city, since its members in successive generations held the officeof "pashishu," or anointing-priest, in the temple of the goddessNinlil.[17]Of such evidence it will suffice for the moment to cite two examples,since they have a direct bearing on the assumption that Rîm-Sin'sconquest of Nîsin put an end to the dynasty in that city. From two ofthe documents we learn that Zîatum, the scribe, pursued his callingat Nippur not only under Damik-ilishu, the last king of Nîsin, butalso under Rîm-Sin of Larsa,[18] a fact which definitely provesthat Nippur passed under the control of these two rulers within thespace of one generation. The other piece of evidence is still moreinstructive. It has long been known that Hammurabi was Rîm-Sin'scontemporary, and from the new Kings' List we have gained the furtherinformation that he succeeded him upon the throne of Larsa. Now twoother of the Nippur documents prove that Ibkushu, the _pashishu,_ or"anointing-priest" of the goddess Ninlil, was living at Nippur underDamik-ilishu and also under Hammurabi in the latter's thirty-firstyear.[19] This fact not only confirms our former inference, but givesvery good grounds for believing that the close of Damik-ilishu's reignmust have fallen within that of Rîm-Sin. We may therefore regard it ascertain that Rîm-Sin's conquest of Nîsin, which began a new era fortime-reckoning in central and southern Babylonia, put an end to thereign of Damik-ilishu and to the Dynasty of Nîsin, of which he wasthe last member. In order to connect the chronology of Babylon withthat of Nîsin it therefore only remains to ascertain at what period inRîm-Sin's reign, as King of Larsa, his conquest of Nîsin took place.It is at this point that a further discovery of Prof. Clay hasfurnished us with the necessary data for a decision. Among the tabletsof the Yale Babylonian Collection he has come across several documentsof Rîm-Sin's reign, which bear a double-date. In every case thefirst half of the double-date corresponds to the usual formula forthe second year of the Nîsin era. On two of them the second half ofthe date-formula equates that year with the eighteenth of some otherera, while on two others the same year is equated with the nineteenthyear.[20] It is obvious that we here have scribes dating documentsaccording to a new era, and explaining that that year correspondsto the eighteenth (or nineteenth) of one with which they had beenfamiliar, and which the new method of time-reckoning was probablyintended to displace. Now we know that, before the capture of Nîsin,the scribes in cities under Rîm-Sin's control had been in the habitof dating documents by events in his reign, according to the usualpractice of early Babylonian kings.[21] But this method was given upafter the capture of Nîsin, and for at least thirty-one years afterthat event the era of Nîsin was in vogue.[22] In the second year of theera, when the new method of dating had just been settled, it would havebeen natural for the scribes to add a note explaining the relationshipof the new era to the old. But, as the old changing formulæ had beendiscontinued, the only possible way to make the equation would havebeen to reckon the number of years Rîm-Sin had been upon the throne.Hence we may confidently conclude that the second figure in thedouble-dates was intended to give the year of Rîm-Sin's reign whichcorresponded to the second year of the Nîsin era.It may seem strange that in some of the documents with thedouble-dates the second figure is given as eighteen and in others asnineteen. There is more than one way in which it is possible to explainthe discrepancy. If we assume that the conquest of Nîsin took placetowards the close of Rîm-Sin's seventeenth year, it is possible that,during the two years that followed, alternative methods of reckoningwere in vogue, some scribes regarding the close of the seventeenthyear as the first year of the new epoch, others beginning the newmethod of time-reckoning with the first day of the following Nisan.Rut that explanation can hardly be regarded as probable, for, in viewof the importance attached to the conquest, the promulgation of thenew era commemorating the event would have been carried out with morethan ordinary ceremonial, and the date of its adoption would not havebeen left to the calculation of individual scribes. It is far morelikely that the explanation is to be sought in the second figure ofthe equation, the discrepancy being due to alternative methods ofreckoning Rîm-Sin's regnal years. Again assuming that the conquesttook place in Rîm-Sin's seventeenth year, those scribes who countedthe years from his first date-formula would have made the second yearof the era the eighteenth of his reign. But others may have includedin their total the year of Rîm-Sin's accession to the throne, and thatwould account for their regarding the same year as the nineteenthaccording to the abolished system of reckoning.[23] This seems thepreferable explanation of the two, but it will be noticed that, oneither alternative, we must regard the first year of the Nîsin era ascorresponding to the seventeenth year of Rîm-Sin's reign.One other point requires to be settled, and that is the relation of theNîsin era to the actual conquest of the city. Was the era inauguratedin the same year as the conquest, or did its first year begin withthe following first of Nisan? In the course of the fifth chapterthe early Babylonian method of time-reckoning is referred to, and itwill be seen that precisely the same question arises with regard tocertain other events commemorated in date-formulæ of the period.[24]Though some features of the system are still rather uncertain, we haveproof that the greater historical events did in certain cases affectthe current date-formula, especially when this was of a provisionalcharacter, with the result that the event was commemorated in the finalformula for the year of its actual occurrence. Arguing from analogy, wemay therefore regard the inauguration of the Nîsin era as coincidingwith the year of the city's capture. In the case of this particularevent the arguments in favour of such a view apply with redoubledforce, for no other victory by a king of Larsa was comparable to it inimportance. We may thus regard the last year of Damik-ilishu, King ofNîsin, as corresponding to the seventeenth year of Rîm-Sin, King ofLarsa. And since the relationship of Rîm-Sin with Hammurabi has beenestablished by the new list of Larsa kings, we are at length furnishedwith the missing synchronism for connecting the dynasties of the NippurKings' List with those of Babylon.[Illustration: VIII. Hammurabi, King of Babylon, from a relief in theBritish Museum, dedicated on his behalf to the West Semitic goddess[Ash]ratum by Itur-ashdum, a provincial governor]We may now return to the difficulty introduced by the new list ofLarsa kings, on which, as we have already noted, the long reign ofRîm-Sin is apparently entered as preceding the thirty-second yearof Hammurabi's rule in Babylon. Soon after the publication of thechronicle, from a broken passage on which it was inferred thatRîm-Sin survived into Samsu-iluna's reign.[25] an attempt was made toexplain the words as referring to a son of Rîm-Sin and not to thatruler himself.[26] But it was pointed out that the sign, which it wassuggested should be rendered as "son," was never employed with thatmeaning in chronicles of the period,[27] and that we must consequentlycontinue to regard the passage as referring to Rîm-Sin. It was furthernoted that two contract-tablets found at Tell Sifr, which record thesame deed of sale, are dated the one by Rîm-Sin, and the other inSamsu-iluna's tenth year.[28] In both of these deeds the same partiesare represented as carrying out the same transaction, and, althoughthere is a difference in the price agreed upon, the same list ofwitnesses occur on both, and both are dated in the same month. The mostreasonable explanation of the existence of the two documents wouldseem to be that, at the period the transaction they record took place,the possession of the town now marked by the mounds of Tell Sifr wasdisputed by Rîm-Sin and Samsu-iluna. Soon after the first of the deedshad been drawn up, the town may have changed hands, and, in order thatthe transaction should still be recognized as valid, a fresh copy ofthe deed was made out with the new ruler's date-formula substitutedfor that which was no longer current.[29] But whatever explanation beadopted, the alternative dates upon the documents, taken in conjunctionwith the chronicle, certainly imply that Rîm-Sin was living at least aslate as Samsu-iluna's ninth year, and probably in the tenth year of hisreign.If, then, we accept the face value of the figures given by the newLarsa Kings' List, we are met by the difficulty already referred to,that Rîm-Sin would have been an active political force in Babyloniasome eighty-three years after his own accession to the throne. Andassuming that he was merely a boy of fifteen when he succeededhis brother at Larsa, he would have been taking the field againstSamsu-iluna in his ninety-eighth year.[30] But it is extremelyunlikely that he was so young at his accession, and, in view of theimprobabilities involved, it is preferable to scrutinize the figuresin the Larsa list with a view to ascertaining whether they are notcapable of any other interpretation.It has already been noted that the Larsa List is a contemporaneousdocument, since the scribe has added the title of "king" to the lastname only, that of Samsu-iluna, implying that he was the reigning kingat the time the document was drawn up. It is unlikely, therefore, thatany mistake should have been made in the number of years assigned toseparate rulers, the date-formulæ and records of whose reigns wouldhave been easily accessible for consultation by the compiler. Thelong reign of sixty-one years, with which Rîm-Sin is credited, mustbe accepted as correct, for it does not come to us as a traditionincorporated in a Neo-Babylonian document, but is attested by a scribewriting within two years of the time when, as we have seen, Rîm-Sin wasnot only living but fighting against the armies of Babylon. In fact,the survival of Rîm-Sin throughout the period of Hammurabi's rule atLarsa, and during the first ten years of Samsu-iluna's reign, perhapsfurnishes us with the solution of our problem.If Rîm-Sin had not been deposed by Hammurabi on his conquest of Larsa,but had been retained there with curtailed powers as the vassal ofBabylon, may not his sixty-one years of rule have included this periodof dependence? In that case he may have ruled as independent King ofLarsa for thirty-nine years, followed by twenty-two years during whichhe owed allegiance successively to Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna, untilin the latter's tenth year he revolted and once more took the fieldagainst Babylon. It is true that, with the missing figures in theKings' List restored as suggested by Professor Clay, the figure for thetotal duration of the dynasty may be cited against this explanation;for the two hundred and eighty-nine years is obtained by regarding thewhole of Rîm-Sin's reign as anterior to Hammurabi's conquest. Thereare two possibilities with regard to the figure. In the first placeit is perhaps just possible that Sin-idinnam and Sin-iḳîsham may havereigned between them thirty-five years, in place of the thirteen yearsprovisionally assigned to them. If that were so, the scribe's totalwould be twenty-two years less than the addition of his figures, andthe discrepancy could only be explained by some such overlapping assuggested. But it is far more likely that the figures are correctlyrestored, and that the scribe's total corresponds to that of thefigures in the list. On such an assumption it is not improbable thathe mechanically added up the figures placed opposite the royal names,without deducting from his total the years of Rîm-Sin's dependent rule.This explanation appears to be the one least open to objection, as itdoes not necessitate the alteration of essential figures, and merelypostulates a natural oversight on the part of the compiler. The placingof Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna in the list after, and not beside, Rîm-Sinwould be precisely on the lines of the Babylonian Kings' List, inwhich the Second Dynasty is enumerated between the First and Third,although, as we now know, it overlapped a part of each. In that case,too, the scribe has added up the totals of his separate dynasties,without any indication of their periods of overlapping. The explanationin both cases is, of course, that the modern system of arrangingcontemporaneous rulers in parallel columns had not been evolved bythe Babylonian scribes. Moreover, we have evidence that at least oneother compiler of a dynastic list was careless in adding up his totals;from one of his discrepancies it would seem that he counted a periodof three months as three years, while in another of his dynasties asimilar period of three months was probably counted twice over both asmonths and years.[31] It is true that the dynastic list in question isa late and not a contemporaneous document, but at least it inclines usto accept the possibility of such an oversight as that suggested on thepart of the compiler of the Larsa list.The only reason which we have as yet examined for equating the firsttwenty-two years of Babylon's suzerainty over Larsa with the latterpart of Rîm-Sin's reign has been the necessity of reducing the durationof that monarch's life within the bounds of probability. If this hadbeen the only ground for the assumption, it might perhaps have beenregarded as more or less problematical. But the Nippur contract-tabletsand legal documents, to which reference has already been made,[32]furnish us with a number of separate and independent pieces of evidencein its support. The tablets contain references to officials and privatepeople who were living at Nippur in the reigns of Damik-ilishu, thelast king of Nîsin, and of Rîm-Sin of Larsa, and also under Hammurabiand Samsu-iluna of Babylon. Most of the tablets of Rîm-Sin's period aredated by the Nîsin era, and, since the dates of those drawn up in thereigns of Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna can be definitely ascertained bymeans of their date-formulæ, it is possible to estimate the intervalsof time separating references to the same man or to a man and hisson. It is remarkable that in some cases the interval of time appearsexcessive if the whole of Rîm-Sin's reign of sixty-one years be placedbefore Hammurabi's capture of Larsa. If, on the other hand, we regardRîm-Sin as Babylon's vassal for the last twenty-two years of his rulein Larsa, the intervals of time are reduced to normal proportions. Asthe point is of some importance for the chronology, it may be as wellto cite one or two examples of this class of evidence, in order thatthe reader may judge of its value for himself.The first example we will examine will be that furnished by Ibkushu,the anointing-priest of Ninlil, to whom we have already referred ashaving lived at Nippur under Damik-ilishu and also under Hammurabi inthe latter's thirty-first year[33]; both references, it may be noted,describe him as holding his priestly office, at Nippur. Now, if weaccept the face value of the figures in the Larsa List we obtain aninterval between these two references of at least forty-four yearsand probably more.[34] By the suggested interpretation of the figuresin the List the interval would be reduced by twenty-two years. A verysimilar case is that of the scribe Ur-kingala, who is mentioned in adocument dated in the eleventh year of the Nîsin era, and again inone of Samsu-iluna's fourth year.[35] In the one case we obtain aninterval of fifty years between the two references, while in the otherit is reduced to twenty-eight years. Very similar results follow if weexamine references on the tablets to fathers and their sons. A certainAdad-rabi, for example, was living at Nippur under Damik-ilishu, whilehis two sons Mâr-irsitim and Mutum-ilu are mentioned there in theeleventh year of Samsu-iluna's reign.[36] In the one case we must inferan interval of at least sixty-seven years, and probably more, betweenfather and sons; in the other an interval of forty-five years or moreis obtained. It will be unnecessary to examine further examples, asthose already cited may suffice to illustrate the point. It willbe noted that the unabridged interval can in no single instance bepronounced impossible. But the cumulative effect produced is striking.The independent testimony of these private documents and contracts thusconverges to the same point as the data with regard to the length ofRîm-Sin's life. Several of the figures so obtained suggest that, takenat their face value, the regnal years in the Larsa List yield a totalthat is about one generation too long. They are thus strongly in favourof the suggested method of interpreting Rîm-Sin's reign in the Larsasuccession.We may thus provisionally place the sixty-first year of Rîm-Sin's ruleat Larsa in the tenth year of Samsu-iluna's reign, when we may assumethat he revolted and took the field against his suzerain. It was inthat year that Tell Sifr changed hands for a time. But it is probably asignificant fact that not a single document of Samsu-iluna's reign hasbeen found in that district dated after his twelfth year. In fact weshall see reason to believe that the whole of Southern Babylonia soonpassed from the control of Babylon, though Samsu-iluna succeeded inretaining his hold on Nippur for some years longer. Meanwhile it willsuffice to note that the suggested sequence of events fits in verywell with other references in the date-lists. The two defeats of Nîsinby Hammurabi and his father Sin-muballit, which have formed for so longa subject of controversy, now cease to be a stumbling-block. We seethat both took place before Rîm-Sin's capture of Nîsin,[37] and weremerely temporary successes which had no effect upon the continuanceof the Nîsin dynasty. That was brought to an end by Rîm-Sin's victoryin his seventeenth year, when the Nîsin era of dating was instituted.That, in cities where it had been long employed, the continued useof the era alongside his own formulæ should have been permittedby Hammurabi for some eight years after his capture of Larsa, issufficiently explained by our assumption that Rîm-Sin was not deposed,but was retained in his own capital as the vassal of Babylon. Therewould have been a natural reluctance to abandon an established era,especially if Babylon's authority was not rigidly enforced during thefirst few years of her suzerainty, as with earlier vassal states.[38]The overlapping of the Dynasty of Nîsin with that of Babylon for aperiod of one hundred and eleven years, which follows from the newinformation afforded by the Yale tablets, merely carries the processstill further that was noted some years ago with regard to the firstthree Dynasties of the Babylonian List of Kings. At the time of theearlier discovery considerable difference of opinion existed as to thenumber of years, if any, during which the Second Dynasty of the Listheld independent sway in Babylonia. The archæological evidence at thattime available seemed to suggest that the kings of the Sea-Countrynever ruled in Babylonia, and that the Third, or Kassite, Dynastyfollowed the First Dynasty without any considerable break.[39] Otherwriters, in their endeavours to use and reconcile the chronologicalreferences to earlier rulers which occur in later texts, assumed aperiod of independence for the Second Dynasty which varied, accordingto their differing hypotheses, from one hundred and sixty-eight toeighty years.[40] Since the period of the First Dynasty was not fixedindependently, the complete absence of contemporary evidence withregard to the Second Dynasty led to a considerable divergence ofopinion upon the point.So far as the archæological evidence is concerned, we are still withoutany great body of documents dated in their reigns, which shoulddefinitely prove the rule of the Sea-Country kings in Babylonia. Buttwo tablets have now been discovered in the Nippur Collections whichare dated in the second year of Iluma-ilum, the founder of the SecondDynasty.[41] And this fact is important, since it proves that for twoyears at any rate he exercised control over a great part of Babylonia.Now among the numerous documents dated in the reigns of Hammurabi andSamsu-iluna, which have been found at Nippur, none are later thanSamsu-iluna's twenty-ninth year, although the succession of dateddocuments up to that time is almost unbroken. It would thus appearthat after Samsu-iluna's twenty-ninth year Babylon lost her hold uponNippur. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the power whichdrove her northwards was the kingdom of the Sea-Country, whose founderIluma-ilum waged successful campaigns against both Samsu-iluna and hisson Abi-eshu', as we learn from the late Babylonian chronicle.[42]Another fact that is probably of equal significance is that, of thetablets from Larsa and its neighbourhood, none have been found datedafter Samsu-iluna's twelfth year, although we have numerous examplesdrawn up during the earlier years of his reign. We may therefore assumethat soon after his twelve years of rule at Larsa, which are assignedto him on the new Kings' List,[43] that city was lost to Babylon. Andagain it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the Sea-Country wasthe aggressor. From Samsu-iluna's own date-formulæ we know that in histwelfth year "all the lands revolted" against him.[44] We may thereforewith considerable probability place Iluma-ilum's revolt in that year,followed immediately by his establishment of an independent kingdomin the south.[45] He probably soon gained control over Larsa andgradually pushed northwards until he occupied Nippur in Samsu-iluna'stwenty-ninth or thirtieth year.[Illustration: X. Brick of Warad-Sin, King of Larsa, recording buildingoperations in the city of Ur]Such appears to be the most probable course of events, so far as itmay be determined in accordance with our new evidence. And since itdefinitely proves that the founder of the Second Dynasty of the Kings'List established, at any rate for a time, an effective control oversouthern and central Babylonia, we are the more inclined to credit thekings of the Sea-Country with having later on extended their authorityfarther to the north. The fact that the compiler of the BabylonianList of Kings should have included the rulers of the Sea-Country inthat document has always formed a weighty argument for regardingsome of them as having ruled in Babylonia; and it was only possibleto eliminate the dynasty entirely from the chronological scheme bya very drastic reduction of his figures for some of their reigns.The founder of the dynasty, for example, is credited with a reign ofsixty years, two other rulers with reigns of fifty-five years, and afourth with fifty years. But the average duration of the reigns in thedynasty is only six years in excess of that for the First Dynasty,which also consisted of eleven kings. And, in view of the sixty-oneyears credited to Rîm-Sin in the newly recovered Larsa List, which is acontemporaneous document and not a later compilation, we may regard thetraditional length of the dynasty as perhaps approximately correct.[46]Moreover, in all other parts of the Kings' List that can be controlledby contemporaneous documents, the general accuracy of the figures hasbeen amply vindicated. The balance of evidence appears, therefore, tobe in favour of regarding the compiler's estimate for the duration ofhis Second Dynasty as also resting on reliable tradition.In working out the chronological scheme it only remains therefore tofix accurately the period of the First Dynasty, in order to arriveat a detailed chronology for both the earlier and the later periods.Hitherto, in default of any other method, it has been necessary torely on the traditions which have come down to us from the history ofBerossus or on chronological references to early rulers which occur inthe later historical texts. A new method of arriving at the date of theFirst Dynasty, in complete independence of such sources of information,was hit upon three years ago by Dr. Kugler, the Dutch astronomer, inthe course of his work on published texts that had any bearing on thehistory and achievements of Babylonian astronomy.[47] Two such tabletshad been found by Sir Henry Layard at Nineveh and were preserved inthe Kouyunjik Collection of the British Museum. Of these one had longof Sippar,Bunutakhtun-ila, occupied the throne in Sumu-la-ilum's reastronomical omens derived from observations of the planet Venus.[48]It was certain that this Assyrian text was a copy of an earlierBabylonian one, since that was definitely stated in its colophon. Thesecond of the two inscriptions proved to be in part a duplicate,[49]and by using them in combination Dr. Kugler was able to restore theoriginal text with a considerable degree of certainty.[50] But a moreimportant discovery was that he succeeded in identifying precisely theperiod at which the text was originally drawn up, and the astronomicalobservations recorded. For he noted that in the eighth section of hisrestored text there was a chronological note, dating that section bythe old Babylonian date-formula for the eighth year of Ammi-zaduga,the tenth king of the First Babylonian Dynasty. As his text containedtwenty-one sections, he drew the legitimate inference that it gave hima series of observations of the planet Venus for each of the twenty-oneyears of Ammi-zaduga's reign.[51]The observations from which the omens were derived consist of datesfor the heliacal rising and setting of the planet Venus. The date wasobserved at which the planet was first visible in the east, the dateof her disappearance was noted, and the duration of her period ofinvisibility; similar dates were then observed of her first appearancein the west as the Evening Star, followed as before by the dates ofher disappearance and her period of invisibility. The taking of suchobservations does not, of course, imply any elaborate astronomicalknowledge on the part of the early Babylonians. This beautiful planetmust have been the first, after the moon, to attract systematicobservation, and thanks to her nearly circular orbit, no water-clocknor instrument for measuring angles was required. The astrologers ofthe period would naturally watch for the planet's first appearance inthe glimmer of the dawn, that they might read therefrom the will of thegreat goddess with whom she was identified. They would note her gradualascension, decline and disappearance, and then count the days of herabsence until she reappeared at sunset and repeated her movements ofascension and decline. Such dates, with the resulting fortunes of thecountry, form the observations noted in the text that was drawn up inAmmi-zaduga's reign.It will be obvious that the periodic return of the same appearance ofthe planet Venus would not in itself have supplied us with sufficientmeans for determining the period of the observations. But we obtainadditional data if we employ our information with the further objectof ascertaining the relative positions of the sun and moon. On the onehand the heliacal risings and settings of Venus are naturally boundup in a fixed relationship of Venus to the sun; on the other hand theseries of dates by the days of the month furnishes us with the relativeposition of the moon with regard to the sun on the days cited. Withoutthe second criterion, the first would be of very little use. But,taken together, the combination of the sun, Venus and the moon areof the greatest value for fixing the position of the group of years,covered by the observations, within any given period of a hundred yearsor more. Now if we eliminate the Second Dynasty altogether from theBabylonian Kings' List, it is certain that Ammi-zaduga's reign couldnot have fallen much later than 1800 B.C.; on the other hand, in viewof the ascertained minimum of overlapping of the First Dynasty by theSecond, it is equally certain that it could not have fallen earlierthan 2060 B.C. The period of his reign must thus be sought within theinterval between these dates. But, in order to be on the safe side,Dr. Kugler extended both the limits of the period to be examined; heconducted his researches within the period from 2080 to 1740 B.C. Hebegan by taking two observations for the sixth year of Ammi-zaduga,which gave the dates for the heliacal setting of Venus in the westand her rising in the east, and, by using the days of the month toascertain the relative positions of the moon, he found that throughoutthe whole course of his period this particular combination took placethree times.[52] He then proceeded to examine in the same way therest of the observations, with their dates, as supplied by the twotablets, and, by working them out in detail for the central one of histhree possible periods, he obtained confirmation of his view that theobservations did cover a consecutive period of twenty-one years. Inorder to obtain independent proof of the correctness of his figures,he proceeded to examine the dates upon contemporary legal documents,which could be brought into direct or indirect relation to the time ofharvest. These dates, according to his interpretation of the calendar,offered a means of controlling his results, since he was able to showthat a higher or lower estimate tended to throw out the time of harvestfrom the month of Nisan, which was peculiarly the harvest month.It must be admitted that the last part of the demonstration stands ina different category to the first; it does not share the simplicityof the astronomical problem. It formed, indeed, merely an additionalmethod of testing the interpretation of the astronomical evidence,and the dates resulting from the latter were obtained in completeindependence of the farming-out contracts of the period. Taking, then,the three alternative dates, there can be no doubt, if we accept thefigure of the Kings' List for the Second Dynasty as approximatelyaccurate, that the central of the three periods is the only onepossible for Ammi-zaduga's reign; for either of the other two wouldimply too high or too low a date for the Third Dynasty of the Kings'List. We may thus accept the date of 1977 B.C. as that of Ammi-zaduga'saccession, and we thereby obtain a fixed point for working out thechronology of the First Dynasty of Babylon, and, consequently, of thepartly contemporaneous Dynasties of Larsa and of Nîsin, and of thestill earlier Dynasty of Ur. Incidentally it assists in fixing withincomparatively narrow limits the period of the Kassite conquest and ofthe following dynasties of Babylon.[53] Starting from this figure as abasis, and making use of the information already discussed, it wouldfollow that the Dynasty of Nîsin was founded in the year 2339 B.C.,that of Larsa only four years later in 2335 B.C., and the First Dynastyof Babylon after a further interval of a hundred and ten years in 2225B.C.[54]It will have been seen that the suggested system of chronology hasbeen settled in complete independence of the chronological noticesto earlier rulers which have come down to us in the inscriptions ofsome of the later Assyrian and Babylonian kings. Hitherto these havefurnished the principal starting points, on which reliance has beenplaced to date the earlier periods in the history of Babylon. In thepresent case it will be pertinent to examine them afresh and ascertainhow far they harmonize with a scheme which has been evolved withouttheir help. If they are found to accord very well with the new system,we may legitimately see in such an agreement additional grounds forbelieving we are on the right track. Without pinning one's faithtoo slavishly to any calculation by a native Babylonian scribe, thepossibility of harmonizing such references at least removes a number ofdifficulties, which it has always been necessary either to ignore or toexplain away.Perhaps the chronological notice which has given rise to mostdiscussion is the one in which Nabonidus refers to the period ofHammurabi's reign. On one of his foundation-cylinders Nabonidus statesthat Hammurabi rebuilt E-babbar, the temple of the Sun-god in Larsa,seven hundred years before Burna-Buriash.[55] At a time when it wasnot realized that the First and Second Dynasties of the Kings' Listwere partly contemporaneous, the majority of writers were content toignore the apparent inconsistency between the figures of the Kings'List and this statement of Nabonidus. Others attempted to get over thedifficulty by emending the figures in the List and by other ingenioussuggestions; for it was felt that to leave a discrepancy of this sortwithout explanation pointed to a possibility of error in any schemenecessitating such a course.[56] We will see, then, how far theestimate of Nabonidus accords with the date assigned to Hammurabi underour scheme. From the Tell el-Amarna letters we know that Burna-Buriashwas the contemporary of Amen-hetep IV., to whose accession mosthistorians of Egypt now agree to assign a date in the early part ofthe fourteenth century B.C.[57] We may take 1480 B.C. as representingapproximately the date which, according to the majority of the schemesof Egyptian chronology, may be assigned to Amen-hetep IV.'s accession.And by adding seven hundred years to this date we obtain, according tothe testimony of Nabonidus, a date for Hammurabi of about 2080 B.C.According to our scheme the last year of Hammurabi's reign fell in 2081B.C., and, since the seven hundred years of Nabonidus is obviouslya round number, its general agreement with the scheme is remarkablyclose.[58]The chronological notice of Nabonidus thus serves to confirm, so faras its evidence goes, the general accuracy of the date assigned to theFirst Dynasty. In the case of the Second Dynasty we obtain an equallystriking confirmation, when we examine the only available referenceto the period of one of its kings which is found in the record of alater ruler. The passage in question occurs upon a boundary-stonepreserved in the University Museum of Pennsylvania, referring to eventswhich took place in the fourth year of Enlil-nadin-apli.[59] In thetext engraved upon the stone it is stated that 696 years separatedGulkishar (the sixth king of the Second Dynasty) from Nebuchadnezzar,who is of course to be identified with Nebuchadnezzar I., the immediatepredecessor of Enlil-nadin-apli upon the throne of Babylon. Now weknow from the "Synchronistic History" that Nebuchadnezzar I. was thecontemporary of Ashur-rêsh-ishi, the father of Tiglath-pileser I., andif we can establish independently the date of the latter's accession,we obtain approximate dates for Nebuchadnezzar and consequently forGulkishar.In his inscription on the rock at Bavian Sennacherib tells us that418 years elapsed between the defeat of Tiglath-pileser I. byMarduk-nadin-akhê and his own conquest of Babylon in 689 B.C.[60]Tiglath-pileser was therefore reigning in 1107 B.C., and we know fromhis Cylinder-inscription that this year was not among the first fiveof his reign; on this evidence the beginning of his reign has beenassigned approximately to 1120 B.C. Nebuchadnezzar I., the contemporaryof Tiglath-pileser's father, may thus have come to the throne at about1140 B.C.; and, by adding the 696 years to this date, we obtain anapproximate date of 1836 B.C. as falling within the reign of Gulkisharof the Second Dynasty. This date supports the figures of the Kings'List, according to which Gulkishar would have been reigning from about1876 to 1822 B.C. But it should be noted that the period of 696 yearsupon the boundary-stone, though it has an appearance of great accuracy,was probably derived from a round number; for the stone refers toevents which took place in Enlil-nadin-apli's fourth year, and thenumber 696 may have been based upon the estimate that seven hundredyears separated Enlil-nadin-apli's reign from that of Gulkishar. It isthus probable that the reference should not be regarded as more than arough indication of the belief that a portion of Gulkishar's reign fellwithin the second half of the nineteenth century. But, even on thislower estimate of the figure's accuracy, its agreement with our schemeis equally striking.One other chronological reference remains to be examined, and that isthe record of Ashur-bani-pal, who, when describing his capture of Susain about 647 B.C., relates that he recovered the image of the goddessNanâ, which the Elamite Kudur-Nankhundi had carried off from Erechsixteen hundred and thirty-five years before.[61] This figure wouldassign to Kudur-Nankhundi's invasion an approximate date of 2282 B.C.As we possess no other reference to, nor record of, an early Elamiteking of this name, there is no question of harmonizing this figure withother chronological records bearing on his reign. All that we can do isto ascertain whether, according to our chronological scheme, the date2282 B.C. falls within a period during which an Elamite king would havebeen likely to invade Southern Babylonia and raid the city of Erech.Tested in this way, Ashur-bani-pal's figure harmonizes well enoughwith the chronology, for Kudur-Nankhundi would have invaded Babyloniafifty-seven years after a very similar Elamite invasion which broughtthe Dynasty of Ur to an end, and gave Nîsin her opportunity of securingthe hegemony.[62] That Elam continued to be a menace to Babyloniais sufficiently proved by Kudur-Mabuk's invasion, which resulted inplacing his son Warad-Sin upon the throne of Larsa in 2143 B.C. It willbe noted that Ashur-bani-pal's figure places Kudur-Nankhundi's raid onErech in the period between the two most notable Elamite invasions ofearly Babylonia, of which we have independent evidence.Another advantage of the suggested chronological scheme is that itenables us to clear up some of the problems presented by the dynastiesof Berossus, at least so far as concerns the historical period inhis system of chronology. In a later historian of Babylon we shouldnaturally expect to find that period beginning with the first dynastyof rulers in the capital; but hitherto the available evidence did notseem to suggest a date that could be reconciled with his system. It maybe worth while to point out that the date assigned under the new schemefor the rise of the First Dynasty of Babylon coincides approximatelywith that deduced for the beginning of the historical period inBerossus. Five of the historical dynasties of Berossus, following hisfirst dynasty of eighty-six kings who ruled for 34,090 years afterthe Deluge,[63] are preserved only in the Armenian version of theChronicles of Eusebius[64] and are the following:--    Dynasty II., 8 Median usurpers, ruling 224 years;[65]    Dynasty III., 11 kings, the length of their rule wanting;[66]    Dynasty IV., 49 Chaldean kings, ruling 458 years;    Dynasty V., 9 Arab kings, ruling for 245 years;    Dynasty VI., 45 kings, ruling for 526 years.It is not quite clear to what stage in the national history Berossusintended his sixth dynasty to extend;[67] and in any case, the factthat the figure is wanting for the length of his third dynasty, renderstheir total duration a matter of uncertainty. But, in spite of thesedrawbacks, a general agreement has been reached as to a date for thebeginning of his historical period, based on considerations independentof the figures in detail. A. von Gutschmid's suggestion that thekings after the Deluge were grouped by Berossus in a cycle of ten_sars, i.e._ 36,000 years,[68] furnished the key that has been usedfor solving the problem. For, if the first dynasty be subtracted fromthis total, the remaining number of years would give the total lengthof the historical dynasties. Thus, if we take the length of the firstdynasty as 34,090 years, the duration of the historical dynasties isseen to have been 1910 years. Now the statement attributed to Abydenusby Eusebius, to the effect that the Chaldeans reckoned their kings fromAlorus to Alexander,[69] has led to the suggestion that the period of1910 years was intended to include the reign of Alexander the Great(331-323 B.C.). If therefore we add 1910 years to 322 B.C., we obtain2232 B.C. as the beginning of the historical period with which thesecond dynasty of Berossus opened. It may be added that the same resulthas been arrived at by taking 34,080 years as the length of his firstdynasty,[70] and by extending the historical period of 1920 years downto 312 B.C., the beginning of the Seleucid Era.Incidentally it may be noted that this date has been harmonized withthe figure assigned in the margin of some manuscripts as representingthe length of tin third dynasty of Berossus. It has usually been heldthat his sixth dynasty ended with the predecessor of Nabonassar uponthe throne of Babylon, and that the following or seventh dynastywould have begun in 747 B.C. But it has been pointed out that, afterenumerating the dynasties II.-VI., Eusebius goes on to say that afterthese rulers came a king of the Chaldeans whose name was Phulus[71];and this phrase has been explained as indicating that the sixthdynasty of Berossus ended at the same point as the Ninth BabylonianDynasty, in 732 B.C., that is to say, with the reign of Nabû-shum-ukîn,the contemporary of Tiglath-pileser IV., whose original name of Pulu ispreserved in the Babylonian List of Kings. Thus the seventh dynasty ofBerossus would have begun with the reign of the usurper Ukîn-zêr, whowas also the contemporary of Tiglath-pileser.[72] On this suppositionthe figure "forty-eight," which occurs in the margin of certainmanuscripts of the Armenian version of Eusebius,[73] may be retainedfor the number of years assigned by Berossus to his third dynasty.[74]A further confirmation of the date 2232 B.C. for the beginning of thehistorical period of Berossus has been found in a statement derivedfrom Porphyrins, to the effect that, according to Callisthenes, theBabylonian records of astronomical observations extended over a periodof 1903 years down to the time of Alexander of Macedon.[75] Assumingthat the reading 1903 is correct, the observations would have extendedback to 2233 B.C., a date differing by only one year from that obtainedfor the beginning of Berossus' historical dynasties.Thus there are ample grounds for regarding the date 2232 B.C.as representing the beginning of the historical period in thechronological system of Berossus;[76] and we have already noted thatin a late Babylonian historian, writing during the Hellenistic period,we should expect the beginning of his history, in the stricter senseof the term, to coincide with the first recorded dynasty of Babylon,as distinct from rulers of other and earlier city-states. It will beobserved that this date is only seven years out with that obtainedastronomically by Dr. Kugler for the rise of the First Dynasty ofBabylon. Now the astronomical demonstration relates only to thereign of Ammi-zaduga, who was the tenth king of the First Dynasty;and to obtain the date 2225 B.C. for Sumu-abum's accession, relianceis naturally placed on figures for the intermediate reigns whichare supplied by the contemporaneous date-lists. But the BabylonianKings' List gives figures which were current in the Neo-Babylonianperiod; and, by employing it in place of contemporaneous records, weobtain the date 2229 B.C. for Sumu-abum's accession, which presentsa discrepancy of only three years to that deduced from Berossus. Inview of the slight inconsistencies with the Kings' List which we findin at least one of the late chronicles, it is clear that the nativehistorians, who compiled their records during the later periods, founda number of small variations in the chronological material on whichthey had to rely. While there was probably agreement on the generallines of the later chronology, the traditional length of some reignsand dynasties might vary in different documents by a few years. We mayconclude therefore that the evidence of Berossus, so far as it canbe reconstituted from the summaries preserved in other works, may beharmonized with the date obtained independently for the First Dynastyof Babylon.The new information, which has been discussed in this chapter, hasenabled us to carry further than was previously possible the processof reconstructing the chronology; and we have at last been able toconnect the earlier epochs in the country's history with those whichfollowed the rise of Babylon to power. On the one hand we have obtaineddefinite proof of the overlapping of further dynasties with that ofthe West Semitic kings of Babylon. On the other hand, the consequentreduction in date is more than compensated by new evidence pointingto the probability of a period of independent rule in Babylonia onthe part of some of the Sea-Country kings. The general effect ofthe new discoveries is thus of no revolutionary character. It hasresulted, rather, in local rearrangements, which to a considerableextent are found to counterbalance one another in their relation to thechronological scheme as a whole. Perhaps the most valuable result ofthe regrouping is that we are furnished with the material for a moredetailed picture of the gradual rise of Babylon to power. We shallsee that the coming of the Western Semites effected other cities thanBabylon, and that the triumph of the invaders marked only the closingstage of a long and varied struggle.[Footnote 1: Cf. "Sumer and Akkad," p. 64.][Footnote 2: The new discoveries, in their general effect, do notinvolve any drastic changes in the accepted chronological scheme, asthe local rearrangements largely counterbalance one another; see below,p. 117 f.][Footnote 3: Cf.

To enablethe reader to follow the argument with regard to the dynasty and itschronology, the following transliteration and rendering may be givenof the text: "21 MU Na-ap-la-nu-um | 28 MU E-mi-su I 35 MU Sa-mn-um| 9 MU Za-ba-aia | 27 MU Gu-un-gu-nu-um | 11 MU A-bi-sa-ri-e | 29 MUSu-mu-ilum | 16 MU Nu-ur-(ilu)Adad | 7 (?)

MU (ilu)Ha-am-mu-ra-bi | 12 MU Sa-am-su-i-lu-na sharru | 289MU-III." In the translation that follows, a semicolon separates eachline of the text: "21 years Naplanum; 28 years Emisa; 35 years Samum; 9years Zabâia; 27 years Gungunum; 11 years Abi-sarê; 29 years Sumu-ilum;10 years Nûr-Adad; 7(?) years Sin-idinnam; 2 years Sin-iribam; 6(?)years Sin-iḳîsham; 1 year Sili-Adad; 12 years Warad-Sin; 61 yearsRîm-Sin; 12(?) years Hammurabi; 12 years Samsu-iluna, the king; 289 theyears thereof." From the insertion of the word _sharru,_ "king," afterSamsu-iluna's name, we may infer that the list is a contemporaneousdocument, drawn up in Samsu-iluna's twelfth year. Another point ofinterest is that the scribe has written the determinative for divinitybefore the names of Rîm-Sin and Hammurabi, but not before that ofSamsu-iluna. The numbers followed by a query are those suggested byProfessor Clay for the three broken passages; it will be noted thatthey make up the total of the figures, which is given by the scribe astwo hundred and eighty-nine years.][Footnote 9: See above, p. 88.][Footnote 10: See further, p. 98 f.][Footnote 11: It should be noted that the name of the Babylonian citynow usually rendered as Isin should be more correctly read as Nîsin.This is suggested by two forms of the name, which Prof. Clay tells meoccur on two tablets in the Yale Babylonian Collection, Nos. 5415 and5417; in the date-formulæ upon these tablets the city's name is writtenas _Ni-i-si-in_ (KI) and _Ni-i-si-in-na_ (KI). Eventually the initialwas dropped; cf. p. 254, n. 2.][Footnote 12: Cf. "Chronicles," I., p. 168, n. 1.][Footnote 13: Cf. Hilprecht, "Mathematical, Metrological andChronological Tablets" (in "Bab.

Langdon has recently sought to identify Rîm-Sin's capturewith that referred to in the formula for Hammurabi's seventh year; see"The Expositor," 1910, p. 131, and "Babyloniaca," 1914, p. 41, and cf.Chiera, "Legal and Administrative Documents," p. 24 f.

On one tablet the addition tothe usual date takes the form _shag mu ki XVIII-kam in-ag (?),_ butProf. Clay is not quite certain of the reading of the sign _ag,_which, he writes, "because the tablet was cased, is badly twisted." Ifthe reading is correct it is important, for the addition may then berendered "within (_i.e._ corresponding to) the eighteenth year that hereigned," the word _in-ag_ being the verb usually employed in Sumeriandynastic lists in sentences stating the number of years a king reigned.Two other long date-formulæ for the same year (on tablets Y.B.C., Nos.4307 and 4481) begin as follows: _mu ki II dim(?) mu ki XIX giš-ku-makhAna (dingir) En-lil (dingir) En-ki,_ etc. Here the reading of thesign _dim_ is not absolutely certain, but, assuming its correctness,the formula may be rendered: "The second year (corresponding to thenineteenth year) in which with the exalted weapon of Anu, Enlil and Ea,Rîm-Sin the king took the city of Nîsin," etc. It will be seen thatthe readings, which are suggested by Prof. Clay for the two uncertainsigns in the formulæ, give excellent sense, and, if correct, theydefinitely prove that the second figures in the equations were derivedfrom Rîm-Sin's regnal years. Hut, even if we regard the two signs asquite uncertain, the general interpretation of the double-dates is notaffected; it would be difficult to explain them on any other hypothesisthan that adopted in the text.][Footnote 21: Some of his earlier date-formulæ have been recovered; seebelow, p. 155.][Footnote 22: For many years past the latest date recovered of theNîsin era was one of the thirtieth year; see Scheil, "Recueil detravaux," XXI. (1899), p. 125, and cf. "Letters of Hammurabi," III.,p. 229. Prof. Clay informs me that among the tablets of the YaleBabylonian Collection is one dated in the thirty-first year of the fallof Nîsin.][Footnote 23: The fact that they had always dated by formulæ, and notby numbered years of the king's reign, is quite sufficient to explainthe uncertainty as to whether the accession-year should be included intheir reckoning. Thus the apparent discrepancy in the double-dates,so far from weakening the explanation put forward in the text, reallyaffords it additional support and confirmation.][Footnote 24: See below, p. 190.][Footnote 25: See "Chronicles concerning early Babylonian Kings," II..p. 18.][Footnote 26: Cf.

The broken linein the chronicle reads: (.........) _zu-na-a_ (m)Rîm-(ilu)Sin ana(.........) illik(ik), "(.........) ... Rîm-Sin to (.........)marched." The rendering suggested by Winckler and Hrozný was:"[.........]zuna, the son of Rîm-Sin, to (.........) marched;" buttheir translation ignored the fact that, in these late chronicles,"son" is always expressed by the sign TUR (_mâru,_) never by A(_aplu_).][Footnote 28: _Cf._ Ungnad, "Zeits. für Assyr.," XXIII., pp. 73 ff.,and Thureau-Dangin, "Journal Asiatique," xiv., 1909, pp. 335 ff.][Footnote 29: The difference in price may perhaps be traced to thepolitical revolution, which may have enabled one of the parties toexact better terms from the other.][Footnote 30: See above, p. 90 f.][Footnote 31: Cf.

Chiera's own deductionfrom the proper names (pp. 29 ff.) must of course be modified in viewof the Larsa Kings' List; but his data hold good.][Footnote 37: On the suggested hypothesis with regard to the LarsaList, Rîm-Sin's capture of Nîsin would have taken place two years afterHammurabi's attack on that city. But, if we reject the hypothesis, theNîsin era would have begun in Sin-muballit's seventh year.][Footnote 38: See pp. 142 ff. The survival of the Nîsin era, duringthe first years of Larsa's vassalage, seems to offer less difficultiesthan those involved in an acceptance of Rîm-Sin's sixty-one years ofindependent rule, followed at first by twenty-one or twenty-two yearsof political obscurity, and then by a period of active operations inthe field. And, apart from the improbabilities involved in the lengthof Rîm-Sin's life, the further difficulty of the interruption of theNîsin era by Sin-muballit's and Hammurabi's conquests of the city wouldstill remain (see above, p. 92 f.).][Footnote 39: That was the view I suggested in "Chronicles concerningEarly Babylonian Kings," I., pp. 96 ff., and it was adopted by Meyer,"Geschichte des Altertums," Bd.

He is evidentlyselected for mention as the leader of the most notable invasion of theperiod.][Footnote 43: See above, p. 90, note.][Footnote 44: See Schorr, "Urkunden des altbab. Ziv. undProzessrechts," p. 595.][Footnote 45: We know that Iluma-ilum was the contemporary of Abi-eshu'as well as of Samsu-iluna. As he is credited by the Kings' List with areign of sixty years, it is possible, if we accept that figure, thathe had established his dynasty in the Sea-Country some years beforeattacking Larsa. His accession has been placed as early as Hammurabi'stwenty-sixth year (cf. Thureau-Dangin, "Zeits. für Assyr.," XXI., pp.176 ff.), though the same writer, by making a reduction of twenty yearsin his dates for the Third and Second Dynasties, afterwards assumedthat he secured his throne in Samsu-iluna's fourth year (_op. cit.,_p. 185 f.). As we have no evidence that Iluma-ilum was Hammurabi'scontemporary, it is safer to place his accession in Samsu-iluna'sreign; and, in that case, the date-formula for the twelfth year appearsto offer the most probable occasion for his revolt.][Footnote 46: The figures are probably not absolutely accurate; seebelow, p. 209, n. 1.][Footnote 47: see his "Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel," 1907-1913.][Footnote 48: This, the principal text, is numbered K. 160, and itstext was published by George Smith in Rawlinson's "Cun.

The Babylonian Kings' Listascribes him twenty-one.][Footnote 52: According to this criterion, Anuni-zaduga's sixth yearcould have fallen in 2036-5 B.C., or in 1972-1 B.C., or in 1853-2 B.C.,thus giving for his first year the three possible dates, 2041-40 B.C.,or 1977-6 b.c., or 1858-7 b.c.][Footnote 53: For this purpose it may be used in conjunction with thelater Assyrian synchronisms, and with the date of Burna-Buriash asobtained from Egyptian sources (see below, p. 111).][Footnote 54: It may be worth while noting-that, if we place the wholeof Rîm-Sin's reign of sixty-one years before Hammurabi's conquest ofLarsa, we raise the first two dates given in the text by twenty-twoyears. On that assumption the Dynasty of Nîsin would have beenfounded in 2361 B.C., and that of Larsa in 2357 B.C. Consequently theDynasties of Nîsin and of Babylon would have overlapped for a period ofeighty-nine years, instead of one hundred and eleven.

For instance, in two of the listsdrawn up under the Nîsin kings, and separated from one another by aninterval of only sixty-seven years, the total duration of the precedingdynasties appears to be given in one as 32,243, and in the other as28,876 years. But this fact does not, of course, prevent the use of thefigures which have come to us from Berossus, in order to ascertain thebeginning of the historical period in the system he employed.]CHAPTER IVTHE WESTERN SEMITES AND THE FIRST DYNASTY OF BABYLONThe rise of Babylon to a position of pre-eminence among the warringdynasties of Sumer and Akkad may be regarded as sealing the finaltriumph of the Semite over the Sumerian. His survival in the longracial contest was due to the reinforcements he received from men ofhis own stock, whereas the Sumerian population, when once settled inthe country, was never afterwards renewed. The great Semitic wave,under which the Sumerian sank and finally disappeared, reached theEuphrates from the coast-lands of the Eastern Mediterranean. Butthe Amurru, or Western Semites, like their predecessors in NorthernBabylonia, had come originally from Arabia. For it is now generallyrecognized that the Arabian peninsula was the first home and cradle ofthe Semitic peoples. Arabia, like the plains of Central Asia, was, infact, one of the main breeding-grounds of the human race, and duringthe historic period we may trace four great migrations of Semitic nomadtribes, which successively broke away from the northern margin of theArabian pasture-lands and spread over the neighbouring countries likea flood. The first great racial movement of the kind is that of whichthe effects were chiefly apparent in Akkad, or Northern Babylonia,where the Semites first obtained a footing when overrunning the valleyof the Tigris and Euphrates. The second is distinguished from thefirst, as the Canaanite or Amorite, since it gave to Canaan its Semiticinhabitants; but how long an interval separated the one movement fromthe other it is impossible to say. The process may well have beena continuous one, with merely a change in the direction of advance;but it is convenient to distinguish them by their effects as separatemovements, the sensitization of Canaan following that of Babylonia, butat the same time contributing to its complete success. Of the latermigrations we are not for the moment concerned, and in any case onlyone of them falls within the period of this history. That was the thirdgreat movement, which began in the fourteenth century and has beentermed the Aramean from the kingdom it established in Syria with itscapital at Damascus. The fourth, and last, took place in the seventhcentury of our own era, when the armies of Islam, after conqueringWestern Asia and Northern Africa, penetrated even to South-WesternEurope. It was by far the most extensive of the four in the area itcovered, and, in spite of being the last of the series, it illustratesthe character and methods of the earlier movements in their initialstages, when the desert nomad, issuing in force from his own borders,came within the area of settled civilization.It is true that great tracts of Central Arabia are to-day quiteuninhabitable, but there is reason to believe that its presentcondition of aridity was not so marked in earlier periods. We havedefinite proof of this in the interior of Southern Arabia, wherethere is still a belt of comparatively fertile country between theflat coastal regions and the steep mountain range, that forms thesouthern boundary of the central plateau.[1] On the coast itselfthere is practically no rainfall, and even on the higher slopes awayfrom the coast it is very scanty. Here the herds of goats frequentlygo without water for many weeks, and they have learnt to pull up andchew the fleshy roots of a species of cactus to quench their thirst.But further still inland there is a broad belt of country, which ismarvellously fertile and in a high state of cultivation. The rainfallthere is regular during a portion of the year, the country is timbered,and the main mountain range, though possessing no towns of any size,is thickly dotted with strong fighting towers, which dominate thewell-farmed and flourishing villages. To the north of the range, beyondthe cultivation, is a belt roamed over by the desert-nomads with theirtypical black tents of woven goat-hair, and then comes the centraldesert, a region of rolling sand. But here and there the ruins ofpalaces and temples may still be seen rising from the sand or built onsome slight eminence above its level.At the time of the Sabæan kingdom, as early as the sixth centuryB.C., this region of Southern Arabia must have been far more fertilethan it is at the present day. The shifting sand, under the drivingpressure of the simoom, doubtless played its part in overwhelmingtracts of cultivated country; but that alone cannot account for thechanged conditions. The researches of Stein, Pumpelly, Huntington andothers have shown the results of desiccation in Central Asia,[2]andit is certain that a similar diminution of the rainfall has takenplace in the interior of Southern Arabia.[3] To such climatic changes,which seem, according to the latest theories, to occur in recurrentcycles,[4] we may probably trace the great racial migrations fromCentral Arabia, which have given their inhabitants to so many countriesof Western Asia and North Africa.It is possible to form a very clear picture of the Semite who issuedfrom this region, for the life of the pastoral nomad, all the worldover, is the same.[5] And even at the present day, in the hollows ofthe Arabian desert, there is enough deposit of moisture to allow of asufficient growth of grass for pasture-lands, capable of supportingnomadic tribes, who move with their flocks of sheep and goats fromone more favoured area to another. The life of such a nomad isforced into one mould by the conditions imposed by the desert; forthe grass-land cannot support him and he must live on the milk andyoung of his flocks. He is purely a shepherd, carrying with him thesimplest and lightest tents, tools, and weapons for his needs. The typeof society is that of the patriarchal family, for each nomad tribeconsists of a group of relatives; and, under the direction of theirchief, not only the men of the clan, but the women and children, alltake an active part in tending the flocks and in practising the simplearts of skin-curing and the weaving of hair and wool. So long as thepasture-lands can support his flocks, the nomad is content to leavethe settled agriculturist beyond the desert edge in peace. Some of thesemi-nomad tribes upon the margin of the cultivation may engage inbarter with their more civilised neighbours, and even at times demandsubsidies for leaving their crops in peace. But the bulk of the tribeswould normally remain within their own area, while conditions existedwhich were capable of supplying the needs of their simple life. It iswhen the pasture lands dry up that the nomad must leave his own areaor perish, and it is then that he descends upon the cultivation andproceeds to adapt himself to new conditions, should he conquer thesettled races whose higher culture he himself absorbs.While still held within the grip of the desert, there was never anyprospect of his development or advance in civilization. The only greatchanges that have taken place in the life of the Arabian nomad havebeen due to the introduction of the horse and the camel. But thesehave merely increased his mobility, while leaving the man himselfunchanged. The Arabs of the seventh century b.c., depicted in thereliefs from Nineveh as fleeing on their camels before the advance ofthe Assyrians, can have differed in no essential feature from theirearliest predecessors, who made their way to the Euphrates valleyon foot or with only the ass as a beast of burden. For, having oncesucceeded in domesticating his flocks and in living by their meansupon the rolling steppes of pasture-land, the nomad's needs are fullysatisfied, and his ways of life survive through succeeding generations.He cannot accumulate possessions, as he must be able to carry all hisgoods continually with him, and his knowledge of the uneventful pastis derived entirely from oral tradition. The earliest inscriptionsrecovered in Arabia are probably not anterior to the sixth centuryb.c., and they were naturally not the work of nomads, but of Semitictribes who had forsaken their wanderings for the settled life ofvillage and township in the more hospitable regions of the south.[Illustration: FIG. 32.ARABS OF THE SEVENTH CENTURY B.C.From a sculpture of the reign of Ashur-bani-pal in the Nineveh Galleryof the British Museum.]The Amurru, or Western Semites, to whose incursion into Babylonia therise of Babylon itself was directly due, had long abandoned a nomadicexistence, and in addition to the higher standards of the agriculturisthad acquired a civilization which had been largely influenced by thatof Babylonia. Thanks to the active policy of excavation, carried outduring the last twenty-five years in Palestine, we are enabled toreconstruct the conditions of life which prevailed in that countryfrom a very early period. It is, in fact, now possible to trace thesuccessive stages of Canaanite civilization back to neolithic times.Rude flint implements of the palaeolithic or Older Stone Age have alsobeen found on the surface of the plains of Palestine, where they hadlain since the close of the glacial epoch. But at that time the climateand character of the Mediterranean lands were very different to theirpresent condition; and a great break of unknown length then occurs inthe cultural sequence, which separates that primæval period from theneolithic or Later Stone Age. It is to this second era that we maytrace the real beginnings of Canaanite civilization. For, from thattime onwards, there is no break in the continuity of culture, and eachage was the direct heir of that which preceded it.[Illustration: FIG. 33.ARABS OF THE SEVENTH CENTURY B.C.From a sculpture of the reign of Ashur-bani-pal in the Nineveh Galleryof the British Museum.]The neolithic inhabitants of Canaan, whose implements of worked andpolished stone mark a great advance upon the rough flints of theirremote predecessors, belonged to the short, dark-skinned race whichspread itself over the shores of the Mediterranean. Dwelling in rudehuts, they employed for household use rough vessels of kneaded claywhich they fashioned by hand and baked in the fire. They lived chieflyby the cattle and flocks they had domesticated, and, to judge bytheir clay spindle-whorls, they practised a simple form of weaving,and began to clothe themselves with cloth in place of skins. Overthese primitive inhabitants a fresh tide of migration swept, probablyin the early part of the third millennium B.C. The new-comers wereSemites from Arabia, of the same stock as those nomadic hordes who hadalready overrun Babylonia and had established themselves in a greatpart of that country. After they had settled in Canaan and Syria theywere known to the Babylonians as the Amurru or Amorites. They weretaller and more vigorous than the neolithic Canaanites, and they seemto have brought with them a knowledge of the use of metal, acquiredprobably by traffic with southern Babylonia.[6] The flint arrows andknives of their enemies would have had little chance against weaponsof copper and bronze. But, whether helped by their superior armamentor not, they became the dominant race in Canaan. By intermarrying withtheir predecessors they produced the Canaanites of history, a peopleof Semitic speech, but with a varying admixture in their blood of thedark-skinned Mediterranean race of lower type.Such in origin was the Canaanite branch of the Western Semites, andit may be worth while to glance for a moment at the main features oftheir culture as revealed by excavation in Palestine.[7] One thingstands out clearly: they revolutionized conditions of life in Canaan.The rude huts of the first settlers were superseded by houses ofbrick and stone, and, in place of villages, cities rose surroundedby massive walls. The city-wall of Gezer was more than thirteen feetthick and was defended by strong towers. That of Megiddo was twenty-sixfeet in thickness, and its foot was further protected by a slope, or_glacis,_ of beaten earth. To secure their water-supply in time ofsiege, the arrangements were equally thorough. At Gezer, for example,a huge tunnel was found, hewn in the solid rock, which gave access toan abundant spring of water over ninety feet below the surface of theground. Not only had the earlier nomad adopted the agricultural life,but he soon evolved a system of defence for his settlements, suggestedby the hilly character of his new country and its ample supply ofstone.[8] Not less remarkable is the light thrown by the excavationson details of Canaanite worship. The centre of each town was the highplace, where huge monoliths were erected, some of them, when unearthed,still worn and polished by the kisses of their worshippers. At Gezerten such monoliths were discovered in a row, and it is worth notingthat they were erected over a sacred cave of the neolithic inhabitants,proving that the ancient sanctuary was taken over by the Semiticinvaders. The religious centres inherited by the Ba'alîm, or local"Lords" of Canaanite worship, had evidently been sanctified by longtradition. In the soil beneath the high places both at Gezer and atMegiddo numbers of jars were found containing the bodies of children,and we may probably see in this fact evidence of infant-sacrifice,the survival of which into later periods is attested by Hebrewtradition. In the cultural remains of these Semitic invaders a distinctdevelopment is discernible. During the earlier period there is scarcelya trace of foreign influence, but later on we find importations fromboth Babylonia and Egypt.It is but natural that southern and central Canaan should have longremained inaccessible to outside influence, and that the effects ofBabylonian civilization should have been confined at first to easternSyria and to the frontier districts scattered along the middle courseof the Euphrates. Recent digging by natives so far to the north as theneighbourhood of Carchemish, for example, have revealed some remarkabletraces of connexion with Babylonia at a very early period.[9] In gravesat Hammam, a village on the Euphrates near the mouth of the Sajûr,cylinder-seals were found which exhibit unmistakable analogies tovery early Babylonian work;[10] and the use of this form of seal at aperiod anterior to the First Dynasty of Babylon is in itself proof thatBabylonian influence had reached the frontier of Syria by the greattrade-route up the course of the Euphrates, along which the armies ofSargon of Akkad had already marched in their raid to the Mediterraneancoast.[11] It is not improbable, too, that Carchemish herself senther own products at this time to Babylon, for one class of her localpottery at any rate appears to have been valued by other races andto have formed an article of export. At the time of the later kingsof the First Dynasty a special kind of large clay vessel, in use inNorthern Babylonia, was known as "a Carchemisian," and was evidentlymanufactured at Carchemish and exported.[12] The trade was no doubtencouraged by the close relations established under Hammurabi and hissuccessors with the West, but its existence points to the possibilityof still earlier commercial intercourse, such as would explain theoccurrence of archaic Babylonian cylinder-seals in early graves in theneighbourhood.But, apart from such trade relations, there is nothing to suggest thatthe early culture of Carchemish and its adjacent districts had beeneffected to any great extent by that of Babylon, nor is there anyindication that the inhabitants of the early city were Semites. Indeed,the archæological evidence is entirely in favour of the opposite view.The bronze age at Carchemish and its neighbourhood is distinguishedfrom the preceding period by the use of metal, by different burialcustoms, and by new types of pottery, and must be regarded as markingthe advent of a foreign people. But throughout the bronze age itself atCarchemish, from its beginning in the third millennium to its close inthe eleventh century B.C., there is a uniform development.[13] There isno sudden outcrop of new types such as had marked its own beginning,and, since in its later periods it was essentially Hittite, we mayassume that it was neither inaugurated nor interrupted by the Semites.Its earlier representatives, before the great Hittite migration fromAnatolia, may well have been a branch of that proto-Mitannian stock,itself possibly of Anatolian origin, evidence of whose presence weshall note at Ashur before the rise of Babylon's First Dynasty.[14][Illustration: X. The Citadel Mound of Carchemish from the north-west.After Hogarth, Carchemish, Pl. 1A]Carchemish lies out of the direct road from Babylon to Northern Syria,and it is remarkable that any trace of early Babylonian influenceshould have been found so far to the north as the mouth of the Sajûr.It is farther down stream, after the Euphrates has turned eastwardtowards its junction with the Khâbûr, that we should expect to findevidence of a more striking character; and it is precisely there, alongthe river route from Syria to Akkad, that we have recovered definiteproof, at the time of the First Dynasty of Babylon, of the existence ofAmorite or West-Semitic settlements with a culture that was Babylonianin its essential features. The evidence is drawn mainly from onedistrict, the kingdom of Khana, which lay not far from the mouth ofthe Khâbûr. One of the chief towns, and probably the capital of thekingdom, was Tirka, the site of which probably lay near Tell 'Ashar orTell 'Ishar, a place situated between Dêr ez-Zôr and Sâlihîya and aboutfour hours from the latter. The identification is certain, since anAssyrian inscription of the ninth century was found there, recordingthe rebuilding of the local temple which is stated in the text tohave been "in Tirka."[15] From about this region three tablets havealso been recovered, all dating from the period of the First Dynastyof Babylon and throwing considerable light on the character of WestSemitic culture in a district within the reach of Babylonian influence.One of these documents records a deed of gift by which Isharlim, a kingof Khana, conveys to one of his subjects a house in a village withinthe district of Tirka.[16] On a second document is inscribed a similardeed of gift by which another king of the same district, Ammi-baïl,the son of Shunu'-rammu, bestows two plots of land on a certainPagirum, described as "his servant," evidently in return for faithfulservice;[17] and, as one of the plots was in Tirka, it is probable thatthe deed was drawn up in that city. The third document is perhaps themost interesting of the three, since it contains a marriage-contractand is dated in the reign of a king who bears the name of Hammurabih.This last ruler has by some been confidently regarded as identical withHammurabi of the First Dynasty of Babylon, and it has been assumed thatit was drawn up at a time when Khana had been conquered and annexed bythat monarch, of whose advance into that region we have independentevidence.[18] But since the tablet appears to be the latest of thethree, it is clear that Khana had been subject to Babylonian influencelong before Hammurabi's conquest. And, even if we regard Hammurabihas no more than a local king of Khana, the document has furnished uswith a West-Semitic variant of Hammurabi's name, or one that is closelyparallel to it.The remarkable fact about all these texts is that they are drawn upin the style of legal documents of the period of the First Dynastyof Babylon. But, while the terminology is much the same, it has beenadapted to local conditions. The early Babylonian method of dating byevents[19] has been taken over, but the formulas are not those in useat this period in Babylonia, but are peculiar to the kingdom of Khana.Thus the first deed of gift is dated in the year when Isharlim, theking, built the great gate of the palace in the city of Kash-dakh;the second was drawn up in the year in which Ammi-baïl, the king,ascended the throne in his father's house; while the marriage-contractis dated in the year that Hammurabih, the king, opened the canalKhabur-ibal-bugash from the city of Zakku-Isharlim to the city ofZakku-Igitlim.[20] The names of the months, too, are not those ofBabylon,[21] and we find evidence that local laws and customs werein force. Each of the deeds of gift, for example, provides that anyinfringement of the rights bestowed by the king is to be punished by amoney-fine of ten manehs of silver, and in addition the delinquent isto undergo the quaint but doubtless very painful process of having hishead tarred with hot tar. From the list of witnesses we gather thatthe community was already organized much on the lines of a provincialdistrict of Babylonia. For, though we find a cultivator or farmeroccupying an important position, we meet also a superintendent of themerchants, another of the bakers, a chief judge, a chief seer, andmembers of the priesthood. It is interesting, too, to note that thekings of Khana were still great landowners, to judge from the fact thatthe lands conveyed in the deeds of gift were surrounded on almost everyside by palace-property. At the same time the chief gods of Khana areassociated with the king in the oath-formulæ, since the royal propertywas also regarded as the property of the Ba'al, or divine "Lord" of thesoil.The two chief Baalim or "Lords" of Khana were the Sun-god and theWest-Semitic deity, Dagon. The latter is constantly referred to inthe documents under the Babylonian form of his name, Dagan. He stoodbeside Shamash on the royal seal and in the local oath-formulæ, andis associated in the latter with Iturmer, who may well have been theold local god of Tirka, deposed after the invasion of the Semites. Histemple in Tirka, which we know survived until the ninth century,[22]was probably the chief shrine of the city, and the great part heplayed in the national life is attested by the constant occurrence ofhis title as a component part of personal names.[23] Later evidenceproves that Dagon was peculiarly the god of Ashdod, and the princelywriter of two of the letters from Tell el-Amarna, who bore the nameDagan-takala, must have ruled some district of northern or centralCanaan. The Khana documents prove that already at the time of the FirstDynasty his cult was established on the Euphrates, and, in view ofthis fact, the occurrence of two early kings of the Babylonian Dynastyof Nîsin with the names of Idin-Dagan and Ishme-Dagan is certainlysignificant. We know, too, that the original home of Ishbi-Ura, thefounder of the Dynasty of Nîsin, was Mari, a city and district onthe middle Euphrates.[24] We may conclude, then, that the Dynastiesof Nîsin and Babylon, and probably that of Larsa, were products ofthe same great racial movement, and that, more than a century beforeSumu-abum established his throne at Babylon, Western Semites haddescended the Euphrates and had penetrated into the southern districtsof the country.The new-comers probably owed their speedy success in Babylonia in greatpart to the fact that many of the immigrant tribes had already acquiredthe elements of Babylonian culture. During their previous residencewithin the sphere of settled civilization they had adopted a way oflife and a social organization which differed but little from that ofthe country into which they came. That they should have immigrated atall in a south-easterly direction, in preference to remaining withintheir own borders, was doubtless due to racial pressure to which theythemselves had been subjected. Canaan was still in a ferment of unrestin consequence of the arrival of fresh nomad tribes within her settleddistricts, and, while many were doubtless diverted southwards towardsthe Egyptian border, others pressed northwards into Syria, exertingan outward pressure in their advance. That the West-Semitic invasionof Babylonia differed so essentially from that of Egypt by the Hyksosis to be explained by this fringe of civilized settlements and pettykingdoms, which formed a check upon the nomad hordes behind them anddominated such of them as succeeded in breaking through. In Egypt thedamage wrought by the Semitic barbarians was remembered for generationsafter their expulsion,[25] whereas in Babylonia the invaders succeededin establishing a dynasty which gave its permanent form to Babyloniancivilization.Nîsin, the city in which, as we have seen, we first obtain anindication of the presence of West-Semitic rulers, probably lay inSouthern Babylonia, and we may picture the earlier immigrants asdescending the course of the Euphrates until they found an opportunityof establishing themselves in the Babylonian plain. The Elamiteconquest, which put an end to the dynasty of Ur, and stripped Babyloniaof her eastern provinces,[26] afforded Nîsin the opportunity ofclaiming the hegemony. Ishbi-Ura, the founder of the new dynasty ofkings, established his own family upon the throne for nearly a century,and we may probably regard his success in bringing his city to thefront as due to the Semitic elements in Southern Babylonia, recentlyreinforced by fresh accretions from the north-west. The centralizationof authority under the later kings of Ur had led to abuses in theadministration, and to the revolt of the Elamite provinces; and when aninvading army appeared before the capital and carried the king, whomhis courtiers had deified, to captivity in Elam,[27] Sumerian prestigereceived a blow from which it never recovered.Shortly after Ishbi-Ura had established himself in Nîsin, we findanother noble, who bore the Semitic name Naplanum, following hisexample, and founding an independent line of rulers in the neighbouringcity of Larsa. But, in spite of the Semitic names borne by these twoleaders and by the kings who succeeded them in their respective cities,it is clear that no great change took place in the character of thepopulation. The commercial and administrative documents of the Nîsinperiod closely resemble those of the Dynasty of Ur, and evidentlyreflect an unbroken sequence in the course of the national life.[28]The great bulk of the southern Babylonians were still Sumerian, and wemay regard the new dynasties both at Nîsin and Larsa as representinga comparatively small racial aristocracy, which by organizing thenational forces in resistance to the Elamites, had succeeded inimposing their own rule upon the native population. At Nîsin theunbroken succession of five rulers is evidence of a settled state ofaffairs, and though Gimil-ilishu reigned for no more than ten years,his son and grandson, as well as his father, Ishbi-Ura, all had longreigns. At Larsa, too, we find Emisu and Samum, who succeeded Naplanum,the founder of the dynasty, each retaining the throne for more thana generation. It is probable that the Sumerians accepted their newrulers without question, and that the latter attempted to introduce nostartling innovations into their system of administrative control.Of the two contemporaneous dynasties in Southern Babylonia, there is nodoubt that Nîsin was the more important. Not only have we the directevidence of the Nippur Kings' List that it was to Nîsin the hegemonypassed from Ur,[29] but what votive texts and building-records havebeen recovered prove that its rulers extended their sway over other ofthe great cities of Sumer and Akkad. A fragmentary text of Idin-Dagan,the son and successor of Gimil-ilishu, found at Abû Habba, proves thatSippar acknowledged his authority,[30] and inscribed bricks of his ownson Ishme-Dagan have been found in the south at Ur.[31]In all their inscriptions, too, the kings of Nîsin lay claim to therule of Sumer and Akkad, while Ishme-Dagan and his son Libit-Ishtar[32]adopt further descriptive titles implying beneficent activities ontheir part in the cities of Nippur, Ur, Erech and Eridu. The recentlypublished inscriptions of Libit-Ishtar, which were recovered during theAmerican excavations at Nippur, prove that in his reign the centralcity and shrine of Babylonia were under Nîsin's active control. But hewas the last king in the direct line from Ishbi-Ura, and it is probablethat the break in the succession may be connected with a temporarydepression in the fortunes of the city; for we shortly have evidenceof an increase in the power of Larsa, in consequence of which the cityof Ur acknowledged her suserainty in place of that of Nîsin. At thetime of Libit-Ishtar's death Zabâia was reigning at Larsa, but afterthree years the latter was succeeded by Gungunum, who not only bore thetitles of king of Larsa and of Ur, but laid claim to the rule of Sumerand Akkad.At any rate, one member of the old dynastic family of Nîsinacknowledged these new claims. Enannatum, Libit-Ishtar's brother,was at this time chief priest of the Moon-temple in Ur, and on conesdiscovered at Mukayyar he commemorates the rebuilding of the Sun-templeat Larsa for the preservation of his own life and that of Gungunum.[33]It is possible that when Ur-Ninib secured the throne of Nîsin, thesurviving members of Ishbi-Ura's family fled from the city to itsrival, and that Enannatum, one of the most powerful of their number,and possibly the direct heir to his brother's throne, was installedby Gungunum in the high-priestly office at Ur. It would be temptingto connect Libit-Ishtar's fall with a fresh incursion of West-Semitictribes, who, recking little of any racial connexion with themselveson the part of the reigning family at Nîsin may have attacked thecity with some success until defeated and driven off by Ur-Ninib. Wenow know that Ur-Ninib conducted a successful campaign against the Sutribes on the west of Babylonia,[34] and in support of the suggestionit would be possible to cite the much discussed date-formula upon atablet in the British Museum, which was drawn up in "the year in whichthe Amurru drove out Libit-Ishtar."[35] But since the Libit-Ishtarof the formula has no title, it is also possible to identify himwith a provincial governor, probably of Sippar, who bore the name ofLibit-Ishtar, and seems to be referred to on other documents inscribedin the reign of Apil-Sin, the grandfather of Hammurabi.[36] The dateassigned to the invasion on the second alternative would correspond toanother period of unrest at Nîsin, which followed the long reign ofEnlil-bani, so that on either alternative we may conjecture that thecity of Nîsin was affected for a time by a new incursion of Amorites.Whether the fall of Libit-Ishtar may be traced to such a cause or not,we now know that it was during the reigns of Ur-Ninib and Gungunum,at Nîsin and at Larsa respectively, that a West-Semitic Dynasty wasestablished at Babylon. Northern Babylonia now fell under the politicalcontrol of the invaders, and it is significant of the new directionof their advance that the only conflict connected in later traditionwith the name of Sumu-abum, the founder of Babylon's independent lineof rulers, was not with either of the dominant cities in Sumer, butwith Assyria in the far north. On a late chronicle it is recorded thatIlu-shûma, King of Assyria, marched against Su-abu, or Sumu-abum,[37]and though the result of the encounter is not related, we may assumethat his motive in making the attack was to check encroachments of theinvaders towards the north and drive them southward into Babylonia.Ilu-shûma's own name is purely Semitic, and since the Amorite godDagan enters into the composition of a name borne by more than oneearly Assyrian ruler, we may assume that Assyria received her Semiticpopulation at about this period as another offshoot of the Amoritemigration.[Illustration: FIG. 34.HEAD OF AN ARCHAIC LIMESTONE FIGURE FROM ASHUR.The primitive character of the sculpture is apparent, and the inlayingof the eyes with shell is characteristic of early work in Babylonia.The figure is possibly that of a female.(After _Mitt. der Deutsch. Orient-Gesellschaft,_ No. 54, p. 9.)]This assumption does not rest entirely on evidence supplied by theroyal names, but finds indirect confirmation in recent archæologicalresearch. The excavations on the site of Ashur, the earliest Assyriancapital, tend to show that the first settlements in that country, ofwhich we have recovered traces, were made by a people closely akin tothe Sumerians of Southern Babylonia.[38] It was in the course of workupon a temple dedicated to Ishtar, the national goddess of Assyria,that remains were found of very early periods of occupation. Below thefoundation of the later building a still older temple was found, alsodedicated to that goddess. Incidentally this building has an interestof its own, for it proved to be the earliest temple yet discoveredin Assyria, dating, as it probably does, from the close of the thirdmillennium B.C. Still deeper excavation, below the level of thisprimitive Assyrian shrine, revealed a stratum in which were severalexamples of rude sculpture, apparently representing, not Semites, butthe early non-Semitic inhabitants of Southern Babylonia.The extremely archaic character of the work is well illustrated by ahead, possibly that of a female figure,[39] in which the inlaying ofthe eyes recalls a familiar practice in early work from Babylonia. Butthe most striking evidence was furnished by heads of male figures,which, if offered for sale without a knowledge of their _provenance,_would undoubtedly have been accepted as coming from Tello or Bismâya,the sites of the early Sumerian cities of Lagash and Adab. The racialtype presented by the heads appears to be purely Sumerian, and, thoughone figure at least is bearded, the Sumerian practice of shaving thehead was evidently in vogue.[40][Illustration: FIG. 35. FIG. 36.HEADS OF ARCHAIC MALE FIGURES FROM ASHUR AND TELLO.A marked feature of both heads is the shaven scalp, exhibiting acharacteristic Sumerian practice. Fig. 35 is from Ashur, Fig. 36 fromTello. (After _M.D.O.G.,_ No. 54, p. 12, and De Sarzec, _Découvertes enChaldée,_ pl. 6, No. 1.)]In other limestone figures, of which the bodies have been preserved,the treatment of the garments corresponds precisely to that in archaicSumerian sculpture. The figures wear the same rough woollen garments,and the conventionalized treatment of the separate flocks of woolis identical in both sets of examples.[41] The evidence is not yetfully published, but, so far as it is available, it suggests that theSumerians, whose presence has hitherto been traced only upon sites inSouthern Babylonia, were also at a very early period in occupation ofAssyria.The violent termination of their settlement at Ashur is attested byan abundance of charred remains, which separate the Sumerian stratumfrom that immediately above it. Had we no evidence to the contrary, itmight have been assumed that their successors were of the same stockas those early Semitic invaders who dominated Northern Babylonia earlyin the third millennium B.C., and pushed eastward across the Tigrisinto Gutium. But it is recognized that the founders of the historiccity of Ashur, records of whose achievements have been recovered inthe early building-inscriptions, bear names which are quite un-Semiticin character. There is a good deal to be said for regarding Ushpia,or Aushpia, the traditional founder of the great temple of the godAshir,[42] and Kikia, the earliest builder of the city's wall,[43] asrepresenting the first arrival of the Mitannian race, which in thefourteenth century played, under new leadership, so dominant a part inthe politics of Western Asia.[44] Not only have their names a Mitanniansound, but we have undoubted evidence of the worship of the Mitannianand Hittite god Teshub as early as the period of the First Dynasty ofBabylon; and the fact that the Mitannian name, which incorporates thatof the deity, is borne by a witness on a Babylonian contract, suggeststhat he came of a civilized and settled race.[45]It is true that the name Mitanni is not met with at this period, butthe geographical term Subartu is,[46] and in later tradition wasregarded as having ranked with Akkad, Elam and Amurru as one of thefour quarters of the ancient civilized world.[Illustration: FIG. 37. FIG. 38. FIG. 39.EXAMPLES OF ARCHAIC SCULPTURE FROM ASHUR AND TELLO, EXHIBITING THE SAMECONVENTION IN THE TREATMENT OF WOOLLEN GARMENTS.The seated statuette (Fig. 37) is from Ashur, and the treatment of thegarment is precisely similar to that in early Tello work (Figs. 38 and39). (After _M.D.O.G.,_ No. 54, p. 18, and _Déc._ pl. 2 (_bis,_) No.1, and pl. 21 (_ter,_) No. 3.)] In the astrological and omen texts,which incorporate very early traditions, the references to Shubartuare interpreted as applying to Assyria,[47] but the term evidently hadan earlier connotation before the rise of Assyria to power. It maywell have included the North-Mesopotamian region known afterwards asthe land of Mitanni, whose rulers are found in temporary occupationof Nineveh, as their predecessors may have established themselves atAshur. But, however that may be, it is clear that the historic city ofAshur was not in its origin either a Sumerian or a Semitic foundation.Its later racial character must date from the period of the WesternSemites, whose amalgamation with an alien and probably Anatolianstrain, which they found there, may account in part for the warlike andbrutal character of the Assyrians of history, so striking a contrast tothat of the milder and more commercial Semites who settled in the lowerEuphrates valley. As in Babylonia, the language and to a great extentthe features of the Semite eventually predominated; and the otherelement in the composition of the race survived only in an increasedferocity of temperament.This was the people of whose attack on Sumu-abum, the founder ofBabylon's greatness, later ages preserved the tradition. No conflictwith Assyria is commemorated in Sumu-abum's date-formulæ, and it ispossible that it took place before he secured his throne in Babylon,and built the great fortification-wall of the city with which heinaugurated his reign. When once he was settled there and had placedthe town in a state of defence, he began to extend his influenceover neighbouring cities in Akkad. Kibalbarru, which he fortifiedwith a city-wall in his third year, was probably in the immediateneighbourhood of Babylon, and we know that Dilbat, the fortificationof which was completed in his ninth year, lay only about seventeenmiles south of the capital.[48] The five years which separated thesetwo efforts at expansion were uneventful from the point of view ofpolitical achievement, for the only noteworthy episodes recordedwere the building of a temple to the goddess Nin-Sinna and anotherto Nannar, the Moon-god, in which he afterwards set up a great cedardoor. It may be that the conflict with Assyria should be set in thisinterval; but we should then have expected some sort of reference tothe successful repulse of the enemy, and it is preferable to place itbefore his first year of rule.His success in the encounter with Assyria may well have afforded thisWest-Semitic chieftain the opportunity of fortifying one of the greattowns of Akkad, and of establishing himself there as its protectoragainst the danger of aggression from the north; and there is no doubtthat Babylon had long had some sort of local governor, the traditionsof whose office he inherited. Since we have references to E-sagila inthe time of the Dynasties of Akkad and of Ur,[49] the former rulersof Babylon were probably no more than the chief priests of Marduk'ssanctuary. That Sumu-abum should have changed the office to that ofking, and that his successor should have succeeded in establishing adynasty that endured for nearly three centuries, is evidence of theunabated energy of the new settlers. Even the later members of thedynasty retained their original West-Semitic character,[50] and thisfact, coupled with the speedy control of other cities than Babylon,suggests that the Western Semites had now arrived in far greaternumbers than during their earlier migration farther down the Euphrates.It is possible to trace the gradual growth of Babylon's influence inAkkad under her new rulers, and the stages by which she threw out hercontrol over an increasing area of territory. At Dilbat, for example,she had no difficulties from the very first, and during almost thewhole period of the First Dynasty the government of the city wasscarcely distinguishable from that of Babylon. The god Urash andthe goddess Lagamal were the patron deities of Dilbat, around whosecult the life of the city centred; and there was a local secularadministration. But the latter was completely subordinate to thecapital, and no effort was made, nor apparently was one required, toretain a semblance of local independence. The treatment of Sippar, onthe other hand, was rather different. Here Sumu-abum appears to haverecognized the local ruler as his vassal; and, as a further concessionto its semi-independent state, he allowed the town the privilege ofcontinuing to use its own date-formulæ, derived from local events.[51]Oaths, it is true, had to be taken in the king of Babylon's name andin that of the great Sun-god of Sippar; but the city could arrange anduse its own system of time-reckoning without reference to the capital'saffairs. Perhaps the most interesting example of Babylon's early systemof provincial government is that presented by the city of Kish, for wecan there trace the gradual extension of her control from a limitedsuzerainty to complete annexation.Kish lay far nearer to Babylon than Dilbat,[52] but it had a moreillustrious past to inspire it than the other city. It had played agreat part in the earlier history of Sumer and Akkad, and at the timeof the West-Semitic occupation of Babylon it was still governed byindependent kings. We have recovered an inscription of one such ruler,Ashduni-erim, who may well have been Sumu-abum's contemporary, for therecord reflects a state of affairs such as would have been caused bya hostile invasion and gradual conquest of the country.[53] AlthoughAshduni-erim lays claim only to the kingdom of Kish, he speaks ingrandiloquent terms of the invasion, relating how the four quarters ofthe world revolted against him. For eight years he fought against theenemy, so that in the eighth year his army was reduced to three hundredmen. But the city-god Zamama and Ishtar, his consort, then came tohis succour and brought him supplies of food. With this encouragementhe marched out for a whole day, and then for forty days he placed theenemy's land under contribution; and he closes his inscription ratherabruptly by recording that he rebuilt the wall of Kish. The clay conewas probably a foundation-record, which he buried within the structureof the city-wall.Ashduni-erim does not refer to his enemy by name, but it is to benoted that the hostile territory lay within a day's march of Kish, adescription that surely points to Babylon. The eight years of conflictfit in admirably with the suggestion, for we know that it was inSumu-abum's tenth year, exactly eight years after his occupation ofKibalbarru, that his suzerainty was acknowledged in Kish. Sumu-abumnamed that year of his reign after his dedication of a crown to thegod Anu of Kish,[54] and we may conjecture that Ashduni-erim, weakenedby the long conflict which he describes, came to terms with hisstronger neighbour and accepted the position of a vassal. Having givenguarantees for his fidelity, he would have received Sumu-abum in Kish,where the latter as the suzerain of the city performed the dedicationhe commemorated in his date-formula for that year. This would fullyexplain the guarded terms in which Ashduni-erim refers to the enemyin his inscription, the rebuilding of the city-wall having, on thissupposition, been undertaken with Babylon's consent.[55][Illustration: HAMMURABI RECEIVING HIS LAWS FROM THE SUN GOD. AfterDélég. en Perse, Mém. IV, pl. 3]That Kish was accorded the position of a vassal state is certain, for,among contract-tablets recovered from the city, several were drawn upin the reign of Mananâ, who was Sumu-abum's vassal. In these documentsthe oath is taken in Mananâ's name, but they are dated by the formulafor Sumu-abum's thirteenth year, commemorating his capture of Kazallu.The importance of the latter event may be held to explain the use ofthe suzerain's own formula, for other documents in Mananâ's reign aredated by local events, proving that at Kish, as at Sippar, a vassalcity of Babylon was allowed the privilege of retaining its own systemof time-reckoning. If we are right in regarding Ashduni-erim asSumu-abum's contemporary, it is clear that he must have been succeededby Mananâ within three years of his capitulation to Babylon. During thenext few years the throne of Kish was occupied by at least three rulersin quick succession, Sumu-ditana, Iawium, and Khalium,[56] for we knowthat by the thirteenth year of Sumu-la-ilum, who succeeded Sumu-abumon the throne of Babylon, the city of Kish had revolted and had beenfinally annexed.The conquest of Kazallu, winch Sumu-abum carried out in the lastyear but one of his reign, was the most important of Babylon's earlyvictories, for it marked an extension of her influence beyond thelimits of Akkad. The city appears to have lain to the east of theTigris, and the two most powerful empires in the past history ofBabylonia had each come into active conflict with it during the earlyyears of their existence. Its conquest by Akkad was regarded inBabylonian tradition as the most notable achievement of Sargon's reign;and at a later period Dungi of Ur, after capturing the Elamite bordercity of Dêr, had extended his empire to the north or east by includingKazallu within its borders.[57] Sumu-abum's conquest was probablylittle more than a successful raid, for in the reign of Sumu-la-ilumKazallu in its turn attacked Babylon, and, by fully occupying herenergies, delayed her southward expansion for some years.In the earlier part of his reign Sumu-la-ilum appears to havedevoted himself to consolidating the position his predecessor hadsecured and to improving the internal resources of his kingdom. TheShamash-khegallum Canal, which he cut immediately on his accession,lay probably in the neighbourhood of Sippar; and later on he furtherimproved the country's system of irrigation by a second canal towhich he gave his own name.[58] The policy he thus inaugurated wasenergetically maintained by his successors, and much of Babylon'swealth and prosperity under her early kings may be traced to thecare they lavished on increasing the area of land under cultivation.Sumu-la-ilum also rebuilt the great fortification-wall of his capital,but during his first twelve years he records only one militaryexpedition.[59] It was in his thirteenth year that the revolt andreconquest of Kish put an end to this period of peaceful development.The importance attached by Babylon to the suppression of this revoltis attested by the fact that for five years it formed an era for thedating of documents, which was only discontinued when the city ofKazallu, under the leadership of Iakhzir-ilum, administered a freshshock to the growing kingdom by an invasion of Babylonian territory.Iakhzir-ilum appears to have secured the co-operation of Kish byinciting it once more to rebellion, for in the following year Babylondestroyed the wall of Anu in that city; and, after re-establishing herauthority there, she devoted her next campaign to carrying the warinto the enemy's country. That the subsequent conquest of Kazallu andthe defeat of its army failed to afford a fresh subject for a nascentera in the chronology is to be explained by the incompleteness of thevictory; for Iakhzir-ilum escaped the fate which overtook his city,and it was only after five years of continued resistance that he wasfinally defeated and slain.[60]After disposing of this source of danger from beyond the Tigris,Sumu-la-ilum continued his predecessor's policy of annexation withinthe limits of Akkad. In his twenty-seventh year he commemorates thedestruction and rebuilding of the wall of Cuthah, suggesting thatthe city had up to that time maintained its independence and now onlyyielded it to force of arms. It is significant that in the same year herecords that he treated the wall of the god Zakar in a similar fashion,for Dûr-Zakar was one of the defences of Nippur,[61] and lay eitherwithin the city-area or in its immediate neighbourhood. That year thusappears to mark Babylon's first bid for the rule of Sumer as wellas of Akkad, for the possession of the central city was regarded ascarrying with it the right of suzerainty over the whole country. It isnoteworthy, too, that this success appears to correspond to a period ofgreat unrest at Nîsin in Southern Babylonia.During the preceding period of forty years the southern cities hadcontinued to rule within their home territory without interferencefrom Babylon. In spite of Sumu-abum's increasing influence in NorthernBabylonia, Ur-Ninib of Nîsin had claimed the control of Akkad in virtueof his possession of Nippur, though his authority cannot have beenrecognized much farther to the north. Like the earlier king of Nîsin,Ishme-Dagan, he styled himself in addition Lord of Erech and patron ofNippur, Ur and Eridu, and so did his son Bûr-Sin II., who succeededhis father after the latter's long reign of twenty-eight years. Ofthe group of southern cities Larsa alone continued to boast a line ofindependent rulers, the throne having passed from Gungunum successivelyto Abi-sarê[62] and Sumu-ilum; and in the latter's reign it would seemthat Larsa for a time even ousted Nîsin from the hegemony in Sinner.For we have recovered at Tello the votive figure of a dog, which acertain priest of Lagash named Abba-dugga dedicated to a goddess on hisbehalf,[63] and in the inscription he refers to Sumu-ilum as King ofUr, proving that the city had passed from the control of Nîsin to thatof Larsa. The goddess, to whom the dedication was made, was Nin-Nîsin,"the Lady of Nîsin," a fact suggestive of the further possibilitythat Nîsin itself may have acknowledged Sumu-ilum for a time. It maybe noted that in the list of Nîsin kings one name is missing afterthose of Itêr-pîsha and Ura-imitti, who followed Bûr-Sin on the thronein quick succession.[64] According to later tradition Ura-imitti hadnamed his gardener, Enlil-bani, to succeed him,[65] and in the listthe missing ruler is recorded to have reigned in Nîsin for six monthsbefore Enlil-bani's accession. It is perhaps just possible that weshould restore his name as that of Sumu-ilum of Larsa,[66] who may havetaken advantage of the internal troubles of Nîsin, not only to annexUr, but to place himself for a few months upon the rival throne, untildriven out by Enlil-bani. However that may be, it is certain that Larsaprofited by the unrest at Nîsin, and we may perhaps also connect withit Babylon's successful incursion in the south.[67]There is no doubt that Sumu-la-ilum was the real founder of Babylon'sgreatness as a military power. We have the testimony of his laterdescendant Samsu-iluna to the strategic importance of the fortresseshe built to protect his country's extended frontier;[68] and, thoughDûr-Zakar of Nippur is the only one the position of which can beapproximately identified, we may assume that the majority of these layalong the east and the south sides of Akkad, where the greatest dangerof invasion was to be anticipated. It does not seem that Nippur itselfpassed at this time under more than a temporary control by Babylon, andwe may assume that, after his successful raid, Sumu-la-ilum was contentto remain within the limits of Akkad, which he strengthened with hisline of forts. In his later years he occupied the city of Barzi, andconducted some further military operations, details of which we havenot recovered; but those were the last efforts on Babylon's part formore than a generation.The pause in expansion gave Babylon the opportunity of husbandingher resources, after the first effort of conquest had been renderedpermanent in its effect by Sumu-la-ilum. His two immediatesuccessors, Zabum and Apil-Sin, occupied themselves with the internaladministration of their kingdom and confined their military activitiesto keeping the frontier intact. Zabum indeed records a successfulattack on Kazallu, no doubt necessitated by renewed aggression onthat city's part; but his other most notable achievements were thefortification of Kâr-Shamash, and the construction of a canal orreservoir.[69] Equally uneventful was the reign of Apil-Sin, for thoughDûr-muti, the wall of which he rebuilt, may have been acquired as theresult of conquest, he too was mainly occupied with the consolidationand improvement of the territory already won. He strengthened the wallsof Barzi and Babylon, cut two canals,[70] and rebuilt some of the greattemples.[71] As a result of her peaceful development during this periodthe country was rendered capable of a still greater struggle, which wasto free Sumer and Akkad from a foreign domination, and, by over-comingthe invader, was to place Babylon for a time at the head of a morepowerful and united empire than had yet been seen on the banks of theEuphrates.The country's new foe was her old rival Elam, who more than once beforehad by successful invasion affected the course of Babylonian affairs.But on this occasion she did more than raid, harry, and return: sheannexed the city of Larsa, and by using it as a centre of control,attempted to extend her influence over the whole of Sumer and Akkad.It was at the close of Apil-Sin's reign at Babylon that Kudur-Mabuk,the ruler of Western Elam, known at this period as the land of Emutbal,invaded Southern Babylonia and, after deposing Sili-Adad[72] of Larsa,installed his own son Warad-Sin upon the throne. It is a testimonyto the greatness of this achievement, that Larsa had for some timeenjoyed over Nîsin the position of leading city in Sumer. Nûr-Adad, thesuccessor of Sumu-ilum, had retained control of the neighbouring cityof Ur, and, though Enlil-bani of Nîsin had continued to lay claim to beKing of Sumer and Akkad, this proud title was wrested from Zambia orhis successor by Sin-idinnam, Nur-Adad's son.[73] Sin-idinnam, indeed,on bricks from Muḳayyar in the British Museum makes a reference to themilitary achievements by which he had won the position for his city.In the text his object is to record the rebuilding of the Moon-god'stemple in Ur, but he relates that he carried out this work after he hadmade the foundation of the throne of Larsa secure and had smitten thewhole of his enemies with the sword.[74] It is probable that his threesuccessors on the throne, who reigned for less than ten years betweenthem, failed to maintain his level of achievement, and that Sin-magirrecovered the hegemony for Nîsin.[75] But Ur, no doubt, remained underLarsa's administration, and it was no mean nor inferior city thatKudur-Mabuk seized and occupied.The Elamite had seen his opportunity in the continual conflicts whichwere taking place between the two rival cities of Sumer. In theircontest for the hegemony Larsa had proved herself successful for atime, but she was still the weaker city and doubtless more exposed toattack from across the Tigris. Hence her selection by Kudur-Mabuk as abasis for his attempt on the country as a whole. He himself retainedhis position in Elam as the _Adda_ of Emutbal; but he installedhis two sons, Warad-Sin and Rîm-Sin, successively upon the throneof Larsa, and encouraged them to attack Nîsin and to lay claim tothe rule of Sumer and Akkad. But the success which attended theirefforts soon brought Babylon upon the scene, and we have the curiousspectacle of a three-cornered contest, in which Nîsin is at war withElam, while Babylon is at war in turn with both. That Sin-muballit,the son of Apil-Sin, did not combine with Nîsin to expel the invaderfrom Babylonian soil, may have played at first into the hands of theElamites. But it is not to be forgotten that the Western Semites ofBabylon were still a conquering aristocracy, and their sympathieswere far from being involved in the fate of any part of Sumer. BothElam and Babylon must have foreseen that the capture of Nîsin wouldprove a decisive advantage to the victor, and each was content to seeher weakened in the hope of ultimate success. When Rîm-Sin actuallyproved the victor in the long struggle, and Larsa under his regisinherited the traditions as well as the material resources of theNîsin Dynasty, the three-cornered contest was reduced to a duelbetween Babylon and a more powerful Larsa. Then for a generation thereensued a fierce struggle between the two invading races, Elam and theWestern Semites, for the possession of the country; and the fact thatHammurabi, Sin-muballit's son, should have emerged victorious, was ajustification in full of his father's policy of avoiding any alliancewith the south. The Western Semites proved themselves in the end strongenough to overcome the conqueror of Nîsin, and thereby they were leftin undisputed possession of the whole of Babylonia.It is possible, with the help of the date-formulæ and votiveinscriptions of the period, to follow in outline the main featuresof this remarkable struggle. At first Kudur-Mabuk's footing in Sumerwas confined to the city of Larsa, though even then he laid claimto the title _Adda_ of Amurru, a reference to be explained perhapsby the suggested Amorite origin of the Larsa and Nîsin dynasties,and reflecting a claim to the suzerainty of the land from which hisnorthern foes at any rate boasted their origin.[76] Warad-Sin, onascending the throne, assumed merely the title King of Larsa, butwe soon find him becoming the patron of Ur, and building a greatfortification-wall in that city.[77] He then extended his authority tothe south and east, Eridu, Lagash, and Girsu all falling before hisarms or submitting to his suzerainty.[78] During this period Babylonremained aloof in the north, and Sin-muballit is occupied with cuttingcanals and fortifying cities, some of which he perhaps occupied for thefirst time.[79] It was only in his fourteenth year, after Warad-Sin hadbeen succeeded at Larsa by his brother Rîm-Sin, that we have evidenceof Babylon taking an active part in opposing Elamite pretensions.[Illustration: BRONZE CONE AND VOTIVE FIGURE. _Brit. Mus., Nos._ 90951_and_ 91016.][Illustration: STONE CYLINDER WITH A VOTIVE INSCRIPTION _Brit. Mus.,No._ 91085.]In that year Sin-muballit records that he slew the army of Ur with thesword, and, since we know that Ur was at this time a vassal-city ofLarsa, it is clear that the army referred to was one of those underRîm-Sin's command. Three years later he transferred his attention fromLarsa to Nîsin, then under the control of Damiḳ-ilishu, the son andsuccessor of Sin-magir. On that occasion Sin-muballit commemorates hisconquest of Nîsin, but it must have been little more than a victory inthe field, for Damiḳ-ilishu lost neither his city nor his independence.In the last year of his reign we find Sin-muballit fighting on theother front, and claiming to have slain the army of Larsa with thesword. It is clear that in these last seven years of his reign Babylonproved herself capable of cheeking any encroachments to the northon the part of Larsa and the Elamites, and, by a continuance of thepolicy of fortifying her vassal-cities,[80] she paved the way for amore vigorous offensive on the part of Hammurabi, Sin-muballit's sonand successor. Meanwhile the unfortunate city of Nîsin was between twofires, though for a few years longer Damiḳ-ilishu succeeded in beatingoff both his opponents.The military successes of Hammurabi fall within two clearly definedperiods, the first during the five years which followed his sixth yearof rule at Babylon, and a second period, of ten years' duration,beginning with the thirteenth of his reign. On his accession he appearsto have inaugurated the reforms in the internal administration ofthe country, which culminated towards the close of his life in thepromulgation of his famous Code of Laws; for he commemorated hissecond year as that in which he established righteousness in theland. The following years were uneventful, the most important royalacts being the installation of the chief-priest in Kashbaran,[81] thebuilding of a wall for the Gagûm, or great Cloister of Sippar, andof a temple to Nannar in Babylon. But with his seventh year we findhis first reference to a military campaign in a claim to the captureof Erech and Nîsin. This temporary success against Damik-ilishu ofNîsin was doubtless a menace to the plans of Rîm-Sin at Larsa, and itwould appear that Kudur-Mabuk came to the assistance of his son bythreatening Babylon's eastern border. At any rate Hammurabi recordsa conflict with the land of Emutbal in his eighth year, and, thoughthe attack appears to have been successfully repulsed with a gainof territory to Babylon,[82] the diversion was successful. Rîm-Sintook advantage of the respite thus secured to renew his attack withincreased vigour upon Nîsin, and in the following year, the seventeenthof his own reign, the famous city fell, and Larsa under her Elamiteruler secured the hegemony in the whole of Central and SouthernBabylonia.Rîm-Sin's victory must have been a severe blow to Babylon, and it wouldseem that she made no attempt at first to recover her position in thesouth, since Hammurabi occupied himself with a raid on Malgûm[83] inthe west and with the capture of the cities of Rabikum and Shalibi.But these were the last successes during his first military period,and for nineteen years afterwards Babylon achieved nothing of asimilar nature to commemorate in her date-formulæ. For the most partthe years are named after the dedication of statues and the buildingand enrichment of temples. One canal was cut,[84] and the process offortification went on, Sippar especially being put in a thorough stateof defence.[85] But the negative evidence supplied by the formulæ forthis period suggests that it was one in which Babylon completely failedin any attempt she may have made to hinder the growth of Larsa's powerin the south.In addition to his capital, Rîm-Sin had inherited from his brotherthe control of the southern group of cities, Ur, Erech, Girsu andLagash, all of which lay to the east of Larsa and nearer to the coast;and it was probably before his conquest of Nîsin that he took Erechfrom Damiḳ-ilishu, who had been attacked there by Hammurabi two yearsbefore. For in more than one of his inscriptions Rîm-Sin refers tothe time when Anu, Enlil and Enki, the great gods, had given the faircity of Erech into his hands.[86] We also know that he took Kisurra,rebuilt the wall of Zabilum, and extended his authority over Kesh,whose goddess Ninmakh, he relates, gave him the kingship over the wholecountry.[87] The most notable result of his conquest of Nîsin was thepossession of Nippur, which now passed to him and regularized hisearlier claim to the rule of Sumer and Akkad. Thereafter he describeshimself as the exalted Prince of Nippur, or as the shepherd of thewhole land of Nippur; and we possess an interesting confirmation ofhis recognition there in a clay cone inscribed with a dedicationfor the prolongation of his life by a private citizen, a certainNinib-gamil.[88]That Rîm-Sin's rule in Sumer was attended by great prosperitythroughout the country as a whole, is attested by the numerouscommercial documents which have been recovered both at Nippur andLarsa and are dated in the era of his capture of Nîsin. There is alsoevidence that he devoted himself to improving the system of irrigationand of transport by water. He canalized a section in the lower courseof the Euphrates, and dug the Tigris to the sea, no doubt removingfrom its main channel an accumulation of silt, which not only hinderedtraffic but increased the danger of flood and the growth of theswamp-area. He also cut the Mashtabba Canal, and others at Nippur andon the Khabilu river.[89] It would seem that, in spite of his Elamiteextraction and the intimate relations he continued to maintain with hisfather Kudur-Mabuk, he completely identified himself with the countryof his adoption; for in the course of his long life he married twice,and both his wives, to judge from their fathers' names, were of Semiticdescent.[90]It was not until nearly a generation had passed, after Rîm-Sin'scapture of Nîsin, that Hammurabi made any headway against the Elamitedomination, which for so long had arrested any increase in the power ofBabylon.[91] But his success, when it came, was complete and enduring.In his thirtieth year he records that he defeated the army of Elam,and in the next campaign he followed up this victory by invadingthe land of Emutbal, inflicting a final defeat on the Elamites, andcapturing and annexing Larsa. Rîm-Sin himself appears to have survivedfor many years, and to have given further trouble to Babylon in thereign of Hammurabi's son, Samsu-iluna.--And the evidence seems to showthat for a few years at least he was accorded the position of vassalruler at Larsa.[92] On this supposition Hammurabi, after his conquestof Sumer, would have treated the old capital in the same way thatSumu-abum treated Kish.[93] But it would seem that after a time Larsamust have been deprived of many of its privileges, including that ofcontinuing its own era of time-reckoning; and Hammurabi's letters toSin-idinnam, his local representative, give no hint of any dividedrule. We may perhaps assume that Rîm-Sin's subsequent revolt was due toresentment at this treatment, and that in Samsu-iluna's reign he seizeda favourable opportunity to make one more bid for independent rule inBabylonia.The defeat of Rîm-Sin, and the annexation of Sumer to Babylon, freedHammurabi for the task of extending his empire on its other threesides. During these later years he twice made successful raids in theElamite country of Tupliash or Ashnunnak, and on the west he destroyedthe walls of Mari and Malgûm, defeated the armies of Turukkum, Kagmumand Subartu, and in his thirty-ninth year he records that he destroyedall his enemies that dwelt beside Subartu. It is probable that heincludes Assyria under the geographical term Subartu, for both Ashurand Nineveh were subject to his rule; and one of his letters provesthat his occupation of Assyria was of a permanent character, andthat his authority was maintained by garrisons of Babylonian troops.Hammurabi tells us too, in the Prologue to his Code of Laws, that hesubjugated "the settlements on the Euphrates," implying the conquest ofsuch local West-Semitic kingdoms as that of Khana.[94] On the west wemay therefore regard the area of his military activities as extendingto the borders of Syria. Up to the close of his reign he continued toimprove the defences of his country, for he devoted his last two yearsto rebuilding the great fortification of Kâr-Shamash on the Tigris andthe wall of Rabikum on the Euphrates, and he once again strengthenedthe city-wall of Sippar. His building-inscriptions also bear witnessto his increased activity in the reconstruction of temples during hisclosing years.[95]An estimate of the extent of Hammurabi's empire may be formed fromthe very exhaustive record of his activities which he himself drew upas the Prologue to his Code. He there enumerates the great cities ofhis kingdom and the benefits he has conferred upon each one of them.The list of cities is not drawn up with any administrative object,but from a purely religious standpoint, a recital of his treatmentof each city being followed by a reference to what he has done forits temple and its city-god. Hence the majority of the cities arenot arranged on a geographical basis, but in accordance with theirrelative rank as centres of religious cult. Nippur naturally headsthe list, and its possession at this time by Babylon had, as we shallsee,[96] far-reaching effects upon the development of the mythologyand religious system of the country. Next in order comes Eridu, invirtue of the great age and sanctity of its local oracle. Babylon,as the capital, comes third, and then the great centres of Moon-andSun-worship, followed by the other great cities and shrines of Sumerand Akkad, the king characterizing the benefits he has bestowed oneach. The list includes some of his western conquests and ends withAshur and Nineveh.[97] It is significant of the racial character ofhis dynasty that Hammurabi should here ascribe his victories on themiddle Euphrates to "the strength of Dagan, his creator," provingthat, like his ancestors before him, he continued to be proud of hisWest-Semitic descent.In view of the closer relations which had now been established betweenBabylonia and the West, it may be interesting to recall that an echofrom these troubled times found its way into the early traditionsof the Hebrews, and has been preserved in the Book of Genesis. Itis there related[98] that Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king ofEllasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim or the"nations," acting as members of a confederation, invaded EasternPalestine to subdue the revolted tribes of that district. Chedorlaomeris represented as the head of the confederation, and though we knowof no Elamite ruler of that name, we have seen that Elam at aboutthis period had exercised control over a great part of Southern andCentral Babylonia, and that its Babylonian capital was the city ofLarsa, with which the Ellasar of the Hebrew tradition is certainly tobe identified.[99] Moreover, Kudur-Mabuk, the historical founder of theElamite domination in Babylonia, did lay claim to the title of _Adda_or ruler of the Amorites.[100] Amraphel of Shinar may well be Hammurabiof Babylon himself, though, so far from acknowledging the suzeraintyof the Elamites, he was their principal antagonist and brought theirdomination to an end. Tidal is a purely Hittite name,[101] and it issignificant that the close of Hammurabi's powerful dynasty was, as weshall see presently, hastened by an invasion of Hittite tribes. Thusall the great nations which are mentioned in this passage in Genesiswere actually on the stage of history at this time, and, though we haveas yet found no trace in secular sources of such a confederation underthe leadership of Elam, the Hebrew record represents a state of affairsin Western Asia which was not impossible during the earlier half ofHammurabi's reign.[102]While Sumu-la-ilum may have laid the foundations of Babylon's militarypower, Hammurabi was the real founder of her greatness. To his militaryachievements he added a genius for administrative detail, and hisletters and despatches, which have been recovered, reveal him as inactive control of even subordinate officials stationed in distantcities of his empire. That he should have superintended matters ofpublic importance is what might be naturally expected; but we alsosee him investigating quite trivial complaints and disputes among thehumbler classes of his subjects, and often sending back a case forretrial or for further report. In fact, Hammurabi's fame will alwaysrest on his achievements as a law-giver, and on the great legal codewhich he drew up for use throughout his empire. It is true that thiselaborate system of laws, which deal in detail with every class ofthe population from the noble to the slave, was not the creativework of Hammurabi himself. Like all other ancient legal codes it wasgoverned strictly by precedent, and where it did not incorporateearlier collections of laws, it was based on careful consideration ofestablished custom. Hammurabi's great achievement was the codificationof this mass of legal enactments and the rigid enforcement of theprovisions of the resulting code throughout the whole territory ofBabylonia. Its provisions reflect the king's own enthusiasm, of whichhis letters give independent proof, in the cause of the humbler and themore oppressed classes of his subjects. Numerous legal and commercialdocuments also attest the manner in which its provisions were carriedout, and we have evidence that the legislative system so establishedremained in practical force during subsequent periods. It may be well,then, to pause at the age of Hammurabi, in order to ascertain themain features of early Babylonian civilization, and to estimate itsinfluence on the country's later development.[Footnote 1: Cf. Hogarth, "The Penetration of Arabia," pp. 206 ff.][Footnote 2: Cf. "Sumer and Akkad," pp. 352 ff.][Footnote 3: An interesting confirmation of this view has been madeby General P.J. Maitland. He points out that the great tanks at Aden,which were hewn out of the solid rock in early Himyarite if not inSabajan times, are at the present day absolutely dry for four years outof five, and that the heaviest rainfalls since they were discovered andcleared out have not filled them to an eighth part of their capacity;cf. his preface to G.

Bury's "Land of Uz," p. xii. f.][Footnote 4: It has been established that these pulsations of climaticchange apply to all the great inland steppes upon the earth's surface,periods of maximum moisture being followed by long intervals ofcomparative aridity; see especially, Huntington, "The Pulse of Asia"(1907).][Footnote 5: On this subject, see especially Myres, "The Dawn ofHistory," pp. 16 ff., 104 ff.][Footnote 6: This view seems to be more probable than the assumptionthat the Semitic inhabitants of Canaan learnt the use of metal aftertheir first period of settlement.][Footnote 7: For the more important monographs on the subject, seeMacalister, "The Excavation of Gezer" (1912), and Bliss and Macalister,"Excavations in Palestine during the years 1898-1900" (1902), bothissued by the Palestine Exploration Fund; Sellin, "Tell Ta'annek,"published by the Vienna Academy in its "Denkschriften," Phil.-Hist.Kl., Bd. 60, No. 4 (1904), and "Eine Nachlese auf dem Tell Ta'annekin Palästina," ibid., Bd. 52, No. 3 (1906); Schumacher, "Tellel-Mutesellim," published by the "Deutscher Palästina Verein" in 1908;and Sellin and Watzinger, "Jericho," a volume issued by the "DeutscheOrient-Gesellschaft" in its "Wissenschaftliche Veröffentlichungen,"Hft. 22 (1913).

There is no doubtthat the city-walls are long anterior to the Egyptian conquest, andfrom the accumulation of _débris_ in the lower strata they have beenprovisionally placed at an early period in the third millennium b.c.;in any case they preceded the age of the First Babylonian Dynasty.][Footnote 9: The evidence has been recovered in connexion withthe excavations at Carchemish, conducted by Mr. Hogarth for theBritish Museum. For discussions of the problems presented by themain excavation, see his volume on "Carchemish" (1914), and "HittiteProblems and the excavation of Carchemish," in the "Proceedings ofthe British Academy," Vol. V. The results of recent native digging inneighbouring mounds have been recovered on the spot by his assistantsMessrs. Woolley and Lawrence, and Mr. Woolley has published an accountof them in a paper ou "Hittite Burial Customs," in the Liverpool"Annals of Archæology," VI., No. 4 (1914), pp. 87 ff.][Footnote 10: In view of the haphazard nature of the native diggings,the absence of cylinder-seals on some neighbouring sites is not tobe taken as necessarily dis-proving Babylonian influence there. AtAmarna, for example, some eight miles to the south of Jerablus, noseals nor cylinders are reported to have been found, but at Kara Kuzal,on the Mesopotamian side of the Euphrates opposite Hammam, where thepottery is of the Amarna type, two cylinder-seals of a later period andprobably of local manufacture were recovered; they are engraved in thestyle classified by Mr. Woolley as "the Syrian Geometric" (_op. cit.,_p. 92). The find is also of interest as proving the assimilation of thecylindrical form of seal, which had then ceased to be merely a foreignimport.][Footnote 11: Cf. "Sumer and Akkad," p. 233 f.][Footnote 12: One of these large vessels is mentioned in an inventoryamong the belongings of a votary of the Sun-god, of which we possesstwo copies dating from the period of the First Dynasty of Babylon; see"Cun.

The canal evidently supplied one of the cities with waterfrom the Khâbûr. The last element in its name is suggestive of Kassiteinfluence, and the script of this document points to a period ratherlater than that of Hammurabi; for its publication, see Johns, "Proc.Soc. Bibl.

"Sumer and Akkad,"p. 303); but we may preferably regard them as representing the firstwave of the movement which was soon to flood Northern Babylonia.][Footnote 29: Cf.

The Ilu-shûma, the father of Irishum or Erishu, who is referredto in building-inscriptions of Shalmaneser I. and Esarhaddon (_op.cit.,_ I., pp. 118 ff.), is probably to be regarded as a later rulerthan Sumu-abum's contemporary.][Footnote 38: Since the year 1903 the Deutsche Orient-Gesellschafthas been conducting excavations at Shergât, the site of Ashur, theold capital of Assyria on the middle Tigris. Monographs on some ofthe temples of the city and its system of fortification have alreadybeen published, and during the summer of 1913 the excavations weredrawing to a close. The greater part of the palace and temple-areahad been uncovered, and detailed plans had been made of all existingbuildings; it only remained to trench still deeper to the virginrock, in order to complete the digging. This process bad naturallybeen left till last, as it involved considerable destruction to thebuildings already uncovered. It was in the course of the deepertrenching that the discoveries referred to in the text were made; forbrief reports of them by Andrae, see the "Mitteilungen der DeutschenOrient-Gesellschaft," No. 54 (June, 1914).][Footnote 39: See Fig. 34.][Footnote 40: See Figs. 35 and 36.][Footnote 41: See p. 140, Figs. 37-39.][Footnote 42: The tradition has survived in the building-inscriptionsof Shalmaneser I. and Esarhaddon, found at Shergât; cf.

Ungnad, "Beitr. z.

Ungnad,"Vorderas. Schriftdenkmäler," VII., No. 72, 1. 10.][Footnote 46: A "man of Subartu" (_awîl Subarti_) is mentioned on adocument of the Hammurabi period (cf. Scheil, "Rec. de tray.," XX., p.64); and a private letter of the time gives directions for the saleinto slavery of certain "Shubareans" (_Shubarî,_) who had probably beencaptured in battle (cf. Meissner, "Beitr. z. Assyr.," II., p. 561 f.,and Delitzsch, _op. cit._ IV., p. 95). On another text "a slave-girlof Shubartu" (_amtum Shubaritum_) is referred to (cf. "Cun. Textsin the Brit. Mus.," VIII., pl. 46. Bu. 91-5-9, 2179, Obv., 1. 20),and "a Shubarean" (_Shubarâ_) is mentioned in an account-tablet amongrecipients of daily rations (cf. Ungnad, "Vorderas. Schriftdenk.,"VII., p. 68, No. 184, Col. III., 1. 3, and "Beitr. z. Assyr.," VI., No.5, p. 19, n. 2).][Footnote 47: For the purpose of interpreting lunar observations,for example, and particularly for eclipses, the face of the moon wasdivided into four quarters, that on the right referring to Akkad, thaton the left to Elam, the upper quarter to Amurru and the lower toSubartu; and one Assyrian astrologer, when reporting to his master anobservation which related to Subartu, explains that "We are Subartu";cf. Thompson, "Reports of the Magicians and Astrologers," II., pp.xviii., lxxxv.][Footnote 48: Dilbat is now marked by the mound of Dêlem, which liesabout seventeen miles to the south of the Ḳaṣr, the old citadel andcentre of Babylon, and less than ten miles to the south-east ofBirs Nimrûd. Many years ago Rassam procured a few tablets there byexcavation (cf. "Asshur and the Land of Nimrod," p. 265), and in recentyears large numbers have been obtained there, as the result of nativedigging, and sold in Europe; they all date from the period of the FirstDynasty of Babylon.][Footnote 49: Cf. "Sumer and Akkad," pp. 226, 282.][Footnote 50: This is particularly apparent in the royal names, theforeign character of which was first pointed out by Pognon, "JournalAsiatique," 8me sér., Vol. XI., pp. 544 ff., who on this evidence alonesuggested that the dynasty might be Arab or Aramean; see further,"Letters of Hammurabi," III., p. lxv., and Meyer, "Geschichte desAltertums," I., ii., p. 545.][Footnote 51: From a local date-formula on one of the tablets fromAbû Habba we have recovered the name of Narâm-Sin, a governor orvassal-ruler of Sippar in Sumu-abum's reign; cf. Ungnad, "Vorderas.Schriftdenkmäler," VIII., No. 3. Another vassal-ruler of Sippar,Bunutakhtun-ila, occupied the throne in Sumu-la-ilum's reign, and tothe same period are to be assigned Iluma-ila and Immerum, of whom thelatter cut the Ashukhi Canal; for references, see Schorr, "Urkunden desaltbabylonischen Zivil- und Processrechts," p. 611.][Footnote 52: Kish is now marked by the mounds of El-Ohêmir, or Aḥimer,which lie to the east of Babylon; cf. "Sumer and Akkad," p. 88 f.][Footnote 53: The text is inscribed upon a clay cone from Aḥimer, andhas been published by Thureau-Dangin, "Rev. d'Assyr.," VIII. (1911),pp. 65 ff.][Footnote 54: That Sumu-abum performed the dedication in his characterof suzerain is proved by a contract-tablet from Kish, which is dated bythe formula for his tenth year.][Footnote 55: It is also possible that the eight years of conflictmay date from Sumu-abum's accession, in which case the text wouldcommemorate a strengthening of the wall of Kish two years before thecapture of the city by Babylon; but the evidence of the date-formulæ isin favour of the tenth year.][Footnote 56: On one of the tablets from Kish Iawium is associated withMananâ in the oath-formula, and from another we know that he survivedSumu-ditana, whom he probably succeeded on the throne; Khalium mayprobably be placed after the other three vassal-rulers whose nameshave been recovered. There appears to have been a local custom at Kishfor each ruler to choose a different god with whom to be associated inthe oath-formulæ; thus, while Zamama, the city-god of Kish, appears inthose of Iawium's reign, his place is taken by Nannar and Sin underMananâ and Khalium respectively. For the tablets and their dates, seeThureau-Dangin, "Rev. d'Assyr.," VIII., pp. 68 ff.; Johns, "Proc.Soc. Bibl. Arch.," XXXII. (1910), p. 279 f.; and Langdon, _op. cit.,_XXXIII. (1911), pp. 185 ff.][Footnote 57: Cf. "Sumer and Akkad," pp. 227, 285 f.][Footnote 58: The Sumu-la-ilum Canal was first constructed in histwelfth year, and it was recut or extended twenty years afterwards.][Footnote 59: The third year of his reign was named as that in which heslew the Khalambû with the sword.][Footnote 60: That in the interval Babylon had no marked success tocommemorate is suggested by the naming of years after the constructionof a throne for Marduk in his temple at Babylon, and of a statue forhis consort, Sarpanitum.][Footnote 61: That the two are to be identified is certain fromSamsu-iluna's reference to Dûr-Zakar of Nippur as among the sixfortresses built by Snmu-la-ilum and rebuilt by himself; see below, pp.148, 204.][Footnote 62: Since Gungunum's death is recorded in a localdate-formula (cf. Scheil, "Rec. de tray.," XXI., p. 125) we may inferthat his end was violent; Abi-sarê's accession may thus mark a break inthe direct succession at Larsa.][Footnote 63: See Thureau-Dangin, "Rev. d'Assyr.," VI., p. 69 f.][Footnote 64: Ura-imitti was not the son of Itêr-pîsha, and since adate-formula of his reign refers to his restoration of the city ofNippur, we may regard its previous destruction or capture as furtherevidence of political trouble at Nîsin; cf. Poebel. "Historical Texts,"p. 138 f.][Footnote 65: Cf. "Sumer and Akkad," p. 312.][Footnote 66: The name was conjecturally restored by Poebel, from adate-formula in the Pennsylvania Museum, as Sin-ikisha (cf. "Orient.Lit.-Zeit.," 1907, col. 461 ff.). But from Prof. Clay's new king-listwe now know that that ruler is to be identified with Sin-iḳîsham,the eleventh king of the Dynasty of Larsa; there is no evidence toconnect him with Nîsin. On the other hand, the six months' rule of theunknown king at Nîsin falls in the twentieth year of Sumu-ilum's reignat Larsa, who at least for a time was recognized in Ur, the formervassal-city of Nîsin.][Footnote 67: According to our scheme of chronology, Sumu-la-ilum'scapture of Dûr-Zakar at Nippur corresponds to the year of Ura-imitti'sdeath and to the subsequent struggle for the throne of Nîsin.][Footnote 68: In addition to Dûr-Zakar of Nippur, these were Dûr-Padda,Dûr-Lagaba, Dûr-Iabugani, Dûr-Cula-dûru, and Dûr-uṣi-ana-Ura. On theirreconstruction Samsu-iluna dedicated the first four to Ninmakh, Adad,Sin and Lugal-diri-tugab, and the last two to Nergal; cf. "Letters ofHammurabi," pp. 199 ff.][Footnote 69: To this he gave the name Tâmtum-khegallum, "the Ocean(gives) abundance." He also rebuilt E-ibianu, E-sagila, and E-babbar inSippar, installing in the last-named temple a bronze image of himself,possibly with the idea of claiming divine honours.][Footnote 70: The Sumu-dâri and Apil-Sin-khegallum Canals were both cutin his reign.][Footnote 71: The costly throne for Shamash and Shunirda, or thegoddess Aia, which he dedicated in his third year, was probably forE-babbar in Sippar. Apil-Sin devoted special attention to Cuthah, themost recently acquired of Babylon's greater possessions, rebuilding ontwo occasions E-meslam, the temple of Nergal, the city-god. He alsoenriched Babylon on the material side, erecting a great city-gate inits eastern wall, and building within the city the temple E-kiku forthe goddess Ishtar and another shrine for the Sun-god.][Footnote 72: For the reading of the weather-god's name as Adad, cf.Budge and King, "Annals of the Kings of Assyria," p. lxxiv. f. Thename was probably of West Semitic origin, though the form Rammânu,"the thunderer," has been noted by Prof. Sayce on a cylinder-sealbeside the goddess Ashratum (cf. "Zeits. f. Assyr.," VI., p. 161),and she elsewhere appears as the spouse of the god Amurru (cf. Meyer,"Geschichte," I., ii., p. 406). The Sumerian equivalent of Adad isstill uncertain; Hrozný suggests the reading Ishkur (cf. "Zeits. f.Assyr.," XX., pp. 424 ff.), while Thureau-Dangin, Clay and othersprefer Immer, suggested in "Königsinschriften," p. 208. Meanwhile it ispreferable to employ the reading Adad, for periods at any rate afterthe West-Semitic invasion.][Footnote 73: That Sin-idinnam's assumption of the title was justifiedby the actual possession of Nippur is proved by a date-formula on acontract in the British Museum, in which he records the dedicationof a statue of himself as an ornament for Nippur; cf. Rawlinson,"Cun. Inscr. West. Asia," IV., pl. 36, No. 2, and Chiera, "Legal andAdministrative Documents," p. 72.][Footnote 74: Cf. Rawlinson, _op. cit.,_ I., pl. 5, No. xx. In additionto his military prowess, he reconstructed E-babbar at Larsa, built thegreat fortress of Dûr-gurgurri, and by canalizing the Tigris improvedhis country's water-supply (cf. "Cun. Texts in the Brit. Mus.," XXL,pl. 30, No. 30215; Delitzsch, "Beitr. zur Assyr.," I., pp. 301 ff.;and Thureau-Dangin, "Königsinschriften," p. 208 f.). He also built thecity-gate of Mashkan-shabri; cf. Chiera, _op. cit.,_ p. 72 f.][Footnote 75: On a broken clay cone from Babylon (cf. Weissbach,"Babylonische Miscellen," p. 1, pl. 1) Sin-magir bears the title ofKing of Sumer and Akkad.][Footnote 76: If we may identify Khallabu with Aleppo, we should finda still firmer basis for Kudur-Mabuk's title. For we know that, whileWarad-Sin was still King of Larsa, he dedicated a chamber in Ishtar'stemple at Khallabu (cf. "Cun. Texts in the Brit. Mus.," XXI., pl.31, No. 91144; and Thureau-Dangin, "Königsinschriften," p. 214 f.).We should then have to assume that, before completing his conquestof Sumer, he had already pushed up and across the Euphrates and hadcaptured large districts of Amurru. It is possible that this was so,but it should be noted that both Khallabu and Bît-Karkara are mentionedin the Prologue to Hammurabi's Code of Laws, not with "the settlementson the Euphrates," but immediately after Lagash and Girsu, suggesting aBabylonian origin (see below, p. 159).][Footnote 77: Cf. Rawlinson, "Cun. Inscr. West. Asia," I., pl. 5, No.xvi.; the erection of the wall is also commemorated in a date-formulaof his reign (cf. Chiera. "Documents," p. 74).][Footnote 78: On a clay cone from Mukayyar, recording his building of atemple to Nannar at Ur, Warad-Sin describes himself as "he who carriesout the decrees and decisions of Eridu (_i.e._ of its oracle), whoincreased the offerings of E-ninnû (the temple of Ningirsu at Lagash),who restored Lavish mid Girsu, and renewed the city and the land"; cf.Rawlinson, _op. cit._ IV., pl. 35, No. 6.][Footnote 79: During the first thirteen years of his reign Sin-muballitcut three canals, the first named after himself, the Sin-muballitCanal, and two others which he termed the Aia-khegallum and theTutu-khegallum. He also built the walls of Rubatum, Zakar-dada,Dûr-Sin-muballit, Bît-Karkara, and Marad. It is possible, of course,that conflicts with the south took place at this time, but, if so, theabsence of any reference to them in the records is to be explained bythe want of success of Babylonian arms.][Footnote 80: In this period the city walls of Nanga and Baṣu wererebuilt.][Footnote 81: From two recently published date-lists of Hammurabi'sreign we know that this event took place in his fifth year, whilethe following year appears to have been dated by a similar priestlyinstallation of the shepherd of the goddess Ninaz; cf. Boissier, "Rev.d'Assyr.," XI., No. iv. (1914), pp. 161 ff.][Footnote 82: The territory gained on the bank of the Shu-numum-darCanal (cf. Boissier, _op. cit._) may have lain in Emutbal. Thecanal was possibly a portion of the famous Nâr-sharri, which in theAchæmenian period was regarded as lying "in Elam."][Footnote 83: The town lay in the neighbourhood of Sukhi on the middleEuphrates, below the mouth of the Khâbûr and probably to the south ofKhana.][Footnote 84: The Tishit-Enlil Canal, which we now know was cutin Hammurabi's twenty-fourth year (cf. Boissier, _op. cit._); theHammurabi-khegallum Canal had been cut in his ninth year, at the timeof Rîm-Sin's capture of Nîsin.][Footnote 85: Two years were devoted to the fortification of Sippar;and the walls of Igi-kharsagga, and probably of Baṣu, were built. Inthe vassal-city of Kibalbarru Hammurabi dedicated an image to Ninni, orIshtar, while in Babylon he built E-namkhe, the temple of Adad, and ashrine also for Enlil.][Footnote 86: Cf. "Déc. en Chaldée," pl. 41; Rawlinson, "Cun.Inscr. West. Asia," I., pl. 3, No. X.; and Thureau-Dangin,"Königsinschriften," p. 218 f.][Footnote 87: See the date-formulæ cited by Chiera, "Documents." p. 80f.][Footnote 88: Cf. Hilprecht, "Old Babylonian Inscriptions," Pt. II.,pl. 58, No. 128.][Footnote 89: Cf. Hilprecht, _loc. cit.,_ and Chiera, _op. cit.,_ p. 82f.][Footnote 90: One of his wives, Si[...]-Ninni, the daughter ofArad-Nannar, dedicated a temple, on his behalf and her own, to thegoddess Nin-egal (cf. Thureau-Dangin, "Königsinschriften," p. 218 f.).The other wife, who bore the name Rîm-Sin-Shala-bashtashu, was thedaughter of a certain Sin-magir, and Rîm-Sin himself had a daughternamed Lirish-gamium; cf. Poebel, "Historical Texts," p. 140, whoquotes the information from an inscription of Rîm-Sin-Shala-bashtashu,which Prof. Clay informs me is now in the Yale Collection. A sister ofRîm-Sin, who was a priestess, is mentioned on a cylinder of Nabonidus(cf. Scheil, "Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Inscriptions et BellesLettres," 1912, p. 680 f.).][Footnote 91: The period would be forty-five years, instead oftwenty-three, if we place the whole sixty-one years of Rîm-Sin'sreign before Hammurabi's conquest of Larsa; in that case the fall ofNîsin would have taken place in Sin-muballit's seventh year. But theavailable evidence is strongly in favour of curtailing Rîm-Sin's periodof independent rule; see above, pp. 97 ff.][Footnote 92: This seems to follow from the continuation of the Nîsinera in the south for a few years after the fall of Larsa; see above, p.103.][Footnote 93: See above, p. 144.][Footnote 94: See above, pp. 129 ff.; it was probably after theseconquests that he adopted the title King of Amurru.][Footnote 95: Cf., _e.g.,_ "Letters and Inscriptions of Hammurabi,"pp. 180 ff. It is clear from the titles in the majority of them thatthey date from the latter part of his reign. It was also after hisannexation of Larsa that he cut the Hammurabi-nukhush-nishi Canal,building a fortress at the head of the canal for its defence, which henamed after his father Dûr-Sin-muballit-abim-walidia. The erection ofthe granary at Babylon (_op. cit.,_ p. 192 f.) was evidently one of hisearlier works.][Footnote 96: See below, p. 194 f.][Footnote 97: As the list of cities is practically a gazetteer ofHammurabi's empire during his closing years, the names will repayenumeration, together with their temples and city-gods; they are heregiven in the order in which they occur in the Prologue, the names ofgods, when omitted in the text, being supplied within parentheses:(1) Nippur, and Ekur, the temple of Enlil; (2) Eridu, and E-apsû(the temple of Enki); (3) Babylon, and E-sagila, the temple ofMarduk; (4) Ur, and E-gishshirgal (the temple of Sin); (5) Sippar,and E-babbar (the temple of Shamash); (6) Larsa, and E-babbar (thetemple of Shamash); (7) Erech, and E-anna, the temple of Anu andNinni, or Ishtar; (8) Nîsin, and the temple E-galmakh; (9) Kish, andE-mete-ursag, the temple of Zamama; (10) Cuthah, and E-meslam (thetemple of Nergal); (11) Borsippa, and E-zida (the temple of Nabû);(12) Dilbat, and its god Urash; (13) the city of Kesh; (14) Lagash andGirsu, and E-ninnû (the temple of Ningirsu); (15) Khallabu, and thegoddess Ninni, or Ishtar; (16) Bît-Karkara, and E-ugalgal, the templeof Adad; (17) Adab, and its temple E-makh; (18) Mashkan-shabri and thetemple Meslam; (19) Malgûm; (20) the dwellings, or settlements, on theEuphrates, and the god Dagan; (21) Mera and Tutul; (22) Akkad (Agade),and E-ulmash, the temple of Ishtar; (23) Ashur, and "its favourableprotecting deity"; and (24) Nineveh, and E-mishmish, the temple ofIshtar.][Footnote 98: Gen. xiv.][Footnote 99: For the Elamite character of Chedorlaomer's name,cf.

It was a time of strenuous growth, in thecourse of which the long struggle with regard to language and racialdominance was decided in favour of the Semite. But the victory involvedno break of continuity, for all the essential elements of Sumerianculture were preserved, the very length of the struggle having provedthe main factor in securing their survival. There had been a gradualassimilation on both sides, though naturally the Sumerian had the moreto give, and, in spite of his political disappearance, he continued toexert an indirect influence. This he owed in the main to the energyof the Western Semite, who completed the task of transforming a dyingculture, so that in its new embodiment it could be accepted by men of anewer race.Hammurabi's age was one of transition, and we have fortunatelyrecovered a great body of contemporaneous evidence on which to basean analysis of its social and political structure. On the one handthe great Code of Laws supplies us with the state's administrativeideal and standard of justice.[1] On the other we have the letters ofthe kings themselves, and the commercial and legal documents of theperiod,[2] to prove that the Code was no dead letter but was accuratelyadjusted to the conditions of the time. The possibility has long beenrecognized of the existence of similar codes of early Sumerian origin,and a copy of one of them, on a tablet of the Hammurabi period, hasrecently been recovered.[3] But the value of Hammurabi's Code restsnot so much in any claim to extensive originality, but rather on itscorrespondence to contemporary needs. It thus forms a first-ratewitness on the subjects with which it deals, and where it gives noinformation, the letters and contracts of the period often enable us tosupply the deficiency.For the purpose of legislation the Babylonian community was dividedinto three main classes or grades of society, which correspondedto well-defined strata in the social system. The highest or upperclass embraced all the officers or ministers attached to the court,the higher officials and servants of the state, and the owners ofconsiderable landed property. But wealth or position did not constitutethe sole qualification distinguishing the members of the upper classfrom that immediately below them. In fact, while the majority of itsmembers enjoyed these advantages, it was possible for a man to forfeitthem through his own fault or misfortune and yet to retain his socialstanding and privileges. It would seem therefore that the distinctionwas based on a racial qualification, and that the upper class, ornobles, as we may perhaps term them,[4] were men of the predominant,race, sprung from the West-Semitic or Amorite stock which had givenBabylon its first independent dynasty. In course of time its racialpurity would tend to become diluted by intermarriage with the olderinhabitants, especially where these had thrown in their lot with theinvaders and had espoused their cause. It is even possible that someof the latter had from the first obtained recognition in its ranks inreturn for military or political service. But, speaking broadly, we mayregard the highest class in the social order as representing a racialaristocracy that had imposed itself.The second class in the population comprised the great body of free menwho did not come within the ranks of the nobles; in fact, they formeda middle class between the aristocracy and the slaves. They bore atitle which in itself implied a state of inferiority,[5] and thoughthey were not necessarily poor and could possess slaves and property,they did not share the privileges of the upper class. It is probablethat they represented the subject race, derived in part from the oldSumerian element in the population, in part from the Semitic strainwhich had long been settled in Northern Babylonia and by intercourseand intermarriage had lost much of its racial purity and independence.The difference, which divided and marked off from one another these twogreat classes of free men in the population, is well illustrated by thescale of payments as compensation for injury which they were obligedto make or were entitled to receive. Thus if a noble should be guiltyof stealing an ox, or other animal, or a boat, which was private ortemple property, he had to pay thirty times its value as compensation;whereas, if the thief were a member of the middle class the penaltywas reduced to ten times the price, and, should he have no propertywith which to pay, he was put to death. The penalty for man-slaughterwas also less if the assailant was a man of the middle class; he couldobtain a divorce more cheaply, and he paid his doctor or surgeona smaller fee for a successful operation. On the other hand, theseprivileges were counterbalanced by a corresponding diminution of thevalue at which his life and limbs were assessed.That a racial distinction underlay the difference in social positionand standing is suggested by the current penalties for assault, inaccordance with which a noble could demand an exact retaliation forinjuries from one of his own class, whereas he merely paid a moneycompensation to any man of the middle class he might have injured. Thusif one noble happened to knock out the eye or the tooth of another, hisown eye or his own tooth was knocked out in return, and if he broke thelimb of one of the members of his own class, he had his correspondinglimb broken; but, if he knocked out the eye of a member of the middleclass, or broke his limb, he was fined one maneh of silver, and forknocking out the tooth of such a man, he was fined one-third of amaneh. Other regulations point to a similar cleavage in the socialstrata, which can best be explained by a difference in race. Thusif two members of the same class quarrelled and one of them made apeculiarly improper assault on the other, the assailant was only fined,the fine being larger if the quarrel was between two nobles. But ifsuch an assault was made by a member of the middle class upon a noble,the assailant was punished by being publicly beaten in the presence ofthe assembly, when he received sixty stripes from an ox-hide scourge.The third and lowest class in the community were the slaves, who wereowned by both the upper classes, but were naturally more numerousin the households of the nobles and on their estates. The slave washis master's absolute property, and on the contract-tablets he isoften referred to as "a head," as though he were merely an animal. Heconstantly changed hands, by sale, bequest, or when temporarily pledgedfor a debt. For bad offences he was liable to severe punishment, suchas cutting off the ear, which was the penalty for denying his master,or for making an aggravated assault upon a noble. But, on the whole,his lot was not a particularly hard one, for he was a recognizedmember of his master's household, and, as a valuable piece ofproperty, it was obviously to his owner's interest to keep him healthyand in good condition. In fact, the value of the slave is attested bythe severity of the penalties exacted for abducting a male or femaleslave from the owner's house and removing one from the city; for thedeath penalty was imposed in such a case, as also on anyone harbouringand taking possession of a runaway slave. On the other hand, a fixedreward was paid by the owner to anyone by whom a runaway was capturedand brought back. Special legislation was also devised with the objectof rendering the theft of slaves difficult and their detection easy.Thus, if a brander put a mark upon a slave without the owner's consent,he was liable to have his hands cut off; and, if he could prove that hehad done so through being deceived by another man, that man was put todeath. There was a regular trade in slaves, and no doubt their numberswere constantly increased by captives taken in war.Though the slaves, as a class, had few rights of their own, there wereregulations in accordance with which, under certain circumstances,they could acquire them, and even obtain their freedom. Thus it waspossible for an industrious slave, while still in his master's service,to acquire property of his own, or a slave might inherit wealth fromrelatives; and, in such circumstances, he was able with his master'sconsent to purchase his freedom. Again, if a slave were captured by theenemy and taken to a foreign land and sold, and were then brought backby his new owner to his own country, he could claim his liberty withouthaving to pay compensation to either of his masters. Moreover, a slavecould acquire certain rights while still in slavery. Thus, if the ownerof a female slave had begotten children by her, he could not use heras payment for a debt; and, in the event of his having done so, he wasobliged to ransom her by paying the original amount of the debt inmoney. It was also possible for a male slave, whether owned by a nobleor by a member of the middle class, to marry a free woman, and if hedid so his children were free and did not become the property of hismaster. His wife, too, if a free woman, retained her marriage-portionon her husband's death, and supposing the couple had acquired propertyduring the time they lived together as man and wife, the owner ofthe slave could only claim half of such property, the other halfbeing retained by the free woman for her own use and for that of herchildren. The mere fact that such a union was possible suggests thatthere was no very marked cleavage between the social status of thebetter class of slaves and that of the humbler members of the middleclass.The cultivation of the land, which formed the principal source of thewealth of Babylonia,[6] was carried on mainly by slave labour, underthe control of the two upper classes of the population. The land itselfwas largely in the hands of the crown, the temples, and the greatnobles and merchants who were landed proprietors; and, including thatstill in communal or tribal possession,[7] a very large proportion wascultivated on lease. The usual practice in hiring land for cultivationwas for the tenant to pay his rent in kind, by assigning a certainproportion of the crop, generally a third or a half, to the owner,who advanced the seed-corn.[8] The tenant was bound to till theland and raise a crop, and should he neglect to do so he had to paythe owner what was reckoned as the average rent of the land, and hehad also to break up the land and plough it before handing it back.Elaborate regulations were in force to adjust the landowner's dutiesand responsibilities on the one hand, and what was due to him from histenant on the other. As the rent of a field was usually reckoned atharvest, and its amount depended on the size of the crop, it would havebeen unfair that damage to the crop from flood or storm should havebeen made up by the tenant; such a loss was shared equally by the ownerof the field and the farmer, though, if the latter had already paidhis rent at the time the damage occurred, he could not make a claimfor repayment. There is evidence that disputes were frequent not onlybetween farmers and landowners, but also between farmers and shepherds,for the latter, when attempting to find pasture for their flocks,often allowed their sheep to feed off the farmers' fields in spring.For such cases a scale of compensation was fixed. If the damage wasdone in the early spring, when the plants were still small, the farmerharvested the crop and received a price in kind as compensation fromthe shepherd. But if it occurred later in the year, when the sheep hadbeen brought in from the meadows and turned on to the common land bythe city-gate, the damage was heavier; in such a case the shepherd hadto take over the crop and compensate the farmer heavily.The king himself was a very large owner of cattle and sheep, and helevied tribute on the flocks and herds of his subjects. The ownerswere bound to bring the young cattle and lambs, that were due fromthem, to the central town of the district in which they dwelt, and theywere then collected and added to the royal flocks and herds. If theowners attempted to hold back any that were due as tribute, they wereafterwards forced to incur the extra expense and trouble of driving thebeasts to Babylon. The flocks and herds owned by the king and the greattemples were probably enormous, and yielded a considerable revenuein themselves apart from the tribute and taxes levied upon privateowners. Shepherds and herdsmen were placed in charge of them, and theywere divided into groups under head-men, who arranged the districtsin which the herds and flocks were to be grazed. The king receivedregular reports from his chief shepherds and herdsmen, and it was theduty of the governors of the larger towns and districts of Babyloniato make tours of inspection and see that due care was taken of theroyal flocks. The sheep-shearing for all the flocks that were pasturednear the capital took place in Babylon, and the king used to send outsummonses to his chief shepherds to inform them of the day when theshearing would take place.[9] Separate flocks, that were royal andpriestly property, were sometimes under the same chief officer, a factthat tends to show that the king himself exercised a considerablemeasure of control over the sacred revenues.[Illustration: PORTION OF THE CODE OF HAMMURABI, COLS. 6-8. AfterDélég. en Perse, Mém. IV, pl. 4.]In the regulation of the pastoral and agricultural life of thecommunity, custom played a very important part, and this was recognizedand enforced by royal authority. Carelessness in looking after cattlewas punished by fine, but the owner was not held responsible for damageunless negligence could be proved on his part. Thus a bull might gowild at any time and gore a man, who would have no redress against itsowner. But if the beast was known to be vicious, and its owner had notblunted its horns nor shut it up, he was obliged to pay compensationfor damage. On the other hand, the owner of cattle or asses, who hadhired them out, could exact compensation for the loss or ill-treatmentof his beasts. These were framed on the principle that the hirer wasresponsible only for damage or loss which; he could reasonably haveprevented. If, for example, a lion killed a hired ox or ass in theopen country, or if an ox was killed by lightning, the loss fell uponthe owner and not on the man who had hired the beast. But if the hirerkilled the ox through carelessness or by beating it unmercifully, orif the beast broke its leg while in his charge, he had to restore tothe owner another ox in its place. For less serious damage to the beastthe hirer paid compensation on a fixed scale.[10] It is clear that suchregulations merely gave the royal sanction to long-established custom.Both for looking after their herds and for the cultivation of theirestates the landed proprietors depended to a great extent upon hiredherdsmen and farmers; and any dishonesty on the part of the latter withregard to cattle, provender, or seed-corn was severely punished. Atheft of provender, for example, had to be made good, and the culpritran the additional risk of having his hands cut off. Heavy compensationwas exacted from any man, who, for his own profit, hired out oxenwhich had been entrusted to his charge; while, if a farmer stole theseed-corn supplied for the field he had hired, so that he produced nocrop to share with the owner, not only had he to pay compensation buthe was liable to be torn in pieces by oxen in the field he should havecultivated.[11] In the age of Hammurabi the heavier penalties were nodoubt largely traditional, having come down from a more barbarous timewhen dishonesty could only be kept in check by strong measures. Theirretention among the statutes doubtless acted as an effective deterrent,and a severe sentence, if carried out occasionally in the case of anaggravated offence, would have sufficed to maintain respect for theregulations.In the semi-tropical climate of Babylonia the canals played a vitallyimportant part for the successful prosecution of agriculture, and itwas to the royal interest to see that their channels were kept in aproper state of repair and cleaned out at regular intervals. Thereis evidence that nearly every king of the First Dynasty of Babyloncut new canals and extended the system of irrigation and transport bywater that he had inherited. The rich silt carried down by the riverswas deposited partly in the canals, especially in those sectionsnearer the main stream, with the result that the bed of a canal wasconstantly in process of being raised. Every year it was necessary todig this deposit out and pile it upon the banks. Every year the banksrose higher and higher, until a point was reached when the labourinvolved in getting rid of the silt became greater than that requiredfor cutting a new channel. Hence sections of a canal were constantlybeing recut alongside the old channel, and it is probable that many ofthe canals, the cutting of which is commemorated in the texts, werereally reconstructions of older streams, the beds of which had becomehopelessly silted up.At the present day the traveller in certain parts of Babylonia comesacross the raised embankments of old canals extending across the plainwithin a short distance of each other, and their parallel course is tobe explained by the process of recutting, which was put off as longas possible, but was at last necessitated by the growing height ofthe banks. As the bed of a canal gradually rose too, the high banksserved the purpose of retaining the stream, and these were often washedaway by the flood-water which came down from the hills in spring. Aninteresting letter has been preserved, that was written by Hammurabi'sgrandson, Abi-eshu', who describes a sudden rise of this sort in thelevel of the Irnina Canal so that it overflowed its banks.[12] At thetime the king was building a palace in the city of Kâr-Irnina, whichwas supplied by the Irnina Canal, and every year a certain amount ofwork was put into the building. At the time the letter was writtenlittle more than a third of the year's work had been done, when thebuilding-operations were stopped by flood, the canal having overflowedits banks so that the water rose right up to the town-wall.It was the duty of the local governors to see that the canals were keptin good repair, and they had the power of requisitioning labour fromthe inhabitants of villages and the owners of land situated on or nearthe banks. In return, the villagers had the right of fishing in thewaters of a canal along the section in their charge, and any poachingby other villagers in their part of the stream was strictly forbidden.On one occasion in the reign of Samsu-iluna, Hammurabi's son, fishermenfrom the village of Itabim went down in their boats to the districtof Shakanim, and caught fish there contrary to local custom. So theinhabitants of Shakanim complained to the king of this infringementof their rights, and he sent a palace-official to the authorities ofSippar. in the jurisdiction of which the villages in question lay, withinstructions to inquire into the matter and take steps to prevent anypoaching in the future. Fishing by line and net was a regular industry,and the preservation of rights in local waters was jealously guarded.The larger canals were fed directly from the river, especially alongthe Euphrates, whose banks were lower than those of the swifterTigris. But along the latter river, and also along the banks of thecanals, it will be obvious that some means had to be employed toraise the water for purposes of irrigation from the main channel tothe higher level of the land. Reference is made in the Babylonianinscriptions to irrigation-machines,[13] and, although their exact formand construction are not described, they must have been very similarto those employed at the present day. The most primitive method ofraising water, which is commoner to-day in Egypt than in Mesopotamia,is the _shadduf,_ which is worked by hand. It consists of a beamsupported in the centre; and at one end a bucket is suspended forraising the water, while at the other end is fixed a counter-weight.Thus comparatively little labour is required to raise the bucket whenfull. That this contrivance was employed on the Tigris is proved by anAssyrian bas-relief, found at Kuyunjik, with representations of the_shadduf_ in operation. Two of them are being used, the one above theother, to raise the water to successive levels. These were probablythe contrivances usually employed by the early Babylonians for raisingthe water to the level of their fields, and the fact that they werelight and easily removed must have made them tempting objects to thedishonest former. A scale of compensation was therefore in force,regulating the payments to be made to the owner by a detected thief.From the fact that these varied, according to the class and valueof the machine he stole, we may infer that other contrivances, of aheavier and more permanent character, were also employed.One of these must certainly have corresponded to a very primitivearrangement that is in general use at the present day in Mesopotamia,particularly along the Tigris, where the banks are high and steep. Arecess or cutting with perpendicular sides is driven into the bank,and a wooden spindle is supported on struts in a horizontal positionover the recess, which resembles a well with one side opening on to theriver. A rope running over the spindle is fastened to a skin in whichthe water is raised from the river, being drawn up by horses, donkeys,or cattle harnessed to the other end of the rope. To empty the skin byhand into the irrigation channel would, of course, entail considerabletime and labour, and, to avoid this necessity, an ingenious contrivanceis employed. The skin is sewn up, not in the form of a closed bag,but of a bag ending in a long narrow funnel. While the skin is beingfilled and drawn to the top, the funnel is kept raised by a thin linerunning over a lower spindle and fastened off to the main rope, sothat both are pulled up together by the beasts. The positions of thespindles and the length of the ropes are so adjusted, that the endof the funnel stops just above a wooden trough on the bank below thestruts, while the rest of the skin is drawn up higher and shoots itswater through the funnel into the trough. The trough is usually madefrom half the trunk of a date-palm, hollowed out, and one end leadsto the irrigation-channel on the bank. To give the beasts a betterpurchase in pulling up the weight of water, an inclined plane is cutin the ground, sloping away from the machine, and up and down this thebeasts are driven, the skin filling and emptying itself automatically.To increase the supply of water, two skins are often employed side byside, each with its own tackle and set of beasts, and, as one is drawnup full, the other is let down empty. Thus a continuous flow of wateris secured, and not more than one man or boy is required to keep eachset of beasts moving. No more effective or simpler method could bedevised of raising water to a considerable height, and there can be nodoubt that, at the period of the First Dynasty, cattle were employednot only for ploughing, but for working primitive irrigation-machinesof this character.On the Euphrates, where the river-banks are lower, a simple form ofwater-wheel was probably in use then as it is to-day, wherever therewas sufficient current to work one. And the advantage of this form ofmachine is that, so long as it is in order, it can be unlocked at willand kept working without supervision day and night. The wheel is formedof stripped boughs and branches nailed together, with spokes joiningthe outer rims to a roughly hewn axle. Around the outer rim are tied aseries of rough earthenware cups or bottles, and a few rude paddles arefixed to the wheel, projecting beyond the rim. The wheel is then setup in place near the bank of the river, its axle resting on pillars ofrough masonry. The current turns the wheel, and the bottles, dippingbelow the surface, are raised up full, and empty their water intoa wooden trough at the top. The banks of the Euphrates are usuallysloping, and the water is conducted from the trough to the fields alonga small aqueduct or earthen embankment. Such wheels to-day are usuallyset up where there is a slight drop in the river-bed and the water runsswiftly over shallows. In order to span the difference in level betweenthe fields and the summer height of the stream the wheels are oftenhuge contrivances, and their rough construction causes them to creakand groan as they turn with the current. In a convenient place in theriver several of these are sometimes set up side by side, and theirnoise when at work can be heard at a great distance.[14]It is not unlikely that the later Sumerians had already evolved theseprimitive forms of irrigation-machine, and that the Babylonians ofthe First Dynasty merely inherited them and passed them on to theirsuccessors. When once invented they were incapable of very greatimprovement. In the one the skin must always remain a skin; in theother the wheel must always be lightly constructed of boughs, or thestrength of the current would not suffice to turn it. We have seenreason to believe that, in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II. at Babylon,the triple well in the north-west corner may be best explained ashaving formed the water-supply for a hydraulic machine, consisting ofan endless chain of buckets passing over a great wheel. Such is a verycommon form of raising water in Babylonia at the present day. It istrue that in some of these machines the wheel for the buckets is stillgeared by means of rough wooden cogs to the long pole or winch, turnedby beasts, who move round in a circle. But it is very unlikely thatthe early Babylonians had evolved the principle of the cogged wheel,and it was probably not till the period of the later Assyrian empirethat bronze was so plentiful that it could have been used in sufficientquantity for buckets on an endless chain. There seems reason to believethat Sennacherib himself introduced an innovation when he employedmetal in the construction of the machines that supplied water to hispalace;[15] and we may infer that even in the Neo-Babylonian period acontrivance of that sort was still a royal luxury, and that the farmercontinued to use the more primitive machines, sanctioned by immemorialusage, which he could make with his own hands.[Illustration: FIG. 40.THE OLD BABYLONIAN FORM OF PLOUGH IN USE.The drawing is taken from seal-impressions on a tablet of the Kassiteperiod.(After Clay.)]The manner in which the agricultural implements employed in earlyBabylonia have survived to the present day is well illustrated bytheir form of plough, which closely resembles that still in use inparts of Syria. We have no representation of the plough of the FirstBabylonian Dynasty, but this was doubtless the same as that of theKassite period, of which a very interesting representation has recentlybeen recovered. On a tablet found at Nippur and dated in the fourthyear of Nazi-Maruttash, are several impressions of a cylinder-sealengraved with a representation of three men ploughing.[16] The ploughis drawn by two humped bulls, or zebu, who are being driven by one ofthe men, while another holds the two handles of the plough and guidesit. The third man has a bag of seed-corn slung over his shouldersand is in the act of feeding seed with his right hand into a tube orgrain-drill, down which it passed into the furrow made by the plough.At the top of the tube is a bowl, with a hole in the bottom openingon to the tube, which acted as a funnel and enabled the sower to dropthe seed in without scattering it. This is the earliest representationof the Babylonian plough that we possess, and its value is increasedby the fact that the plough is seen in operation. The same seed-drilloccurs in three later representations. One of these also dates fromthe Kassite period, being found upon a boundary-stone of the period ofMeli-Shipak II.,[17] on which it is sculptured as the sacred symbolof Geshtinna, the goddess of the plough.[18] The other two are ofthe Assyrian period, one being represented in enamelled brick on thewalls of the palace at Khorsabad,[19] the other being carved among thesymbols on the Black Stone of Esarhaddon, on which he gives an accountof his restoration of Babylon.[20] Similar ploughs, with grain-drillsof precisely the same structure, are still used in Syria at the presenttime.[21]Before ploughing and sowing his land the Babylonian farmer preparedit for irrigation by dividing it up into a number of small squaresor oblong patches, each separated from the others by a low bank ofearth. Some of the banks, that ran lengthways through the field, weremade into small channels, the ends of which were connected with hismain irrigation-stream. No gates nor sluices were employed, and, whenhe wished to water one of his fields, he simply broke away the bankopposite one of his small channels and let the water flow into it.When it reached the part of his land he wished to water, he blocked thechannel with a little earth and broke down its bank so that the waterflowed over one of the small squares and soaked it.[Illustration; A MODERN GUFA Photo by Messrs. Underwood & Underwood.]He could then repeat the process with the next square, and so on,afterwards returning to the main channel and stopping the flow of waterby blocking up the hole he had made in the bank. Such is the presentprocess of irrigation in Mesopotamia, and there is no doubt that itwas adopted by the early Babylonians. It was extremely simple, butneeded care and vigilance, especially when water was being carried intoseveral parts of an estate at once. Moreover, one main channel oftensupplied the fields of several farmers, and, in return for his shareof the water, it was the duty of each man to keep its banks, where itcrossed his land, in repair. If he failed to do so and the water forceda breach and flooded his neighbour's field, he had to pay compensationin kind for any crop that was ruined, and, if he could not pay, hisgoods were sold, and his neighbours, whose fields had been damaged,shared the proceeds of the sale. Similarly, if a farmer left his waterrunning and forgot to shut it off, he had to pay compensation for anydamage it might do to a neighbouring crop.The date-palm formed the chief secondary source of the country'swealth, for it grew luxuriantly in the alluvium and supplied theBabylonians with one of their principal articles of diet.[22] Fromit, too, they made a fermented wine, and a species of flour forbaking; its sap yielded palm-sugar, and its fibrous bark was suitablefor weaving ropes, while its trunk furnished a light but toughbuilding-material. The early Babylonian kings encouraged the layingout of date-plantations and the planting of gardens and orchards; andspecial regulations were made with that object in view. For a man couldobtain a field for the purpose without paying a yearly rent. He couldplant and tend it for four years, and in the fifth year of his tenancythe original owner of the land took half the garden in payment, whilethe planter kept the other half for himself. Care was taken to seethat the bargain was properly carried out, for, if a bare patch hadbeen left in the plantation, it was reckoned in the planter's half;and should the tenant neglect the trees during his first four yearsof occupation, he was still liable to plant the whole plot withoutreceiving his half of it, and he had to pay compensation in addition,which varied in amount according to the original condition of the land.In this way the authorities ensured that land should not be taken overand allowed to deteriorate. For the hire of a plantation the rent wasfixed at two-thirds of its produce, the tenant providing all labour andsupplying the necessary irrigation-water.[Illustration: FIG. 41.ASSYRIAN KELEK ON THE TIGRIS. (After Layard.)]From the royal letters of the period of the First Dynasty we know thatthe canals were not only used for irrigation, but also as water-waysfor transport.---The letters contain directions for the bringing ofcorn, dates, sesame-seed, and wood to Babylon, and we also know thatwool and oil were carried in bulk by water. For transport of heavygoods on the Tigris and Euphrates it is possible that rafts, floatedon inflated skins, were used from an early period, though the earliestevidence we have of their employment is furnished by the bas-reliefsfrom Nineveh. Such rafts have survived to the present day,[23] andthey are specially adapted for the transport of heavy materials, forthey are carried down by the current, and are kept in the main streamby means of huge sweeps or oars. Being formed only of logs of wood andskins, they are not costly, for wood was plentiful in the upper courseof the rivers. At the end of the journey, after the goods were landed,they were broken up, the logs being sold at a profit, and the skins,after being deflated, were packed on donkeys to return up stream bycaravan.[24][Illustration: FIG. 42.THE ASSYRIAN PROTOTYPE OF THE GUFA.(From a bas-relief in the British Museum.)]The use of such _keleks_ can only have been general when through-rivercommunication was general, but, since we know that Hammurabi includedAssyria within his dominions, it is not impossible that they may datefrom at least as early a period as the First Dynasty. For purely localtraffic in small bulk the _gufa,_ or light coracle, may have been usedin Babylonia at this time, for its representation on the Assyrianmonuments corresponds exactly with its structure at the present timeas used; on the lower Tigris and Euphrates. The _gufa_ is formed ofwicker-work coated with bitumen, but some of those represented on thesculptures from Nineveh appear to have been covered with skins as inthe description of Herodotus.[25]In the texts and inscriptions of the early period ships are referredto, and these were undoubtedly the only class of vessels employed onthe canals for conveying supplies in bulk by water. The size of suchships, or barges, was reckoned by the amount of grain they were capableof carrying, measured by the _gur,_ the largest measure of capacity. Wefind vessels of very different size referred to, varying from five toseventy-five _gur_ and over. The larger class probably resembled thesailing barges and ferry-boats in use to-day,[26] which are built ofheavy timbers and have flat bottoms when intended for the transport ofbeasts. In Babylon at the time of the First Dynasty a boat-builder'sfee for constructing a vessel of sixty _gur_ was fixed at two shekelsof silver, and it was proportionately less for vessels of smallercapacity. A boat-builder was held responsible for unsound work, andshould defects develop in a vessel within a year of its being launched,he was obliged to strengthen or rebuild it at his own expense. Boatmenand sailors formed a numerous class in the community, and the yearlywage of a man in such employment was fixed at sixty _gur_ of corn.Larger vessels carried crews under the command of a captain, or chiefboatman, and there is evidence that the vessels owned by the kingincluded many of the larger type, which he employed for carrying grain,wool and dates, as well as wood and stone for building-operations.[Illustration: FIG. 43.ASSYRIAN RAFT OF LOGS ON THE TIGRIS.(From a bas-relief in the British Museum.)]It is probable that there were regular officials, under the king'scontrol, who collected dues and looked after the water-transport in theseparate sections of the river, or canal, on which they were stationed.It would have been their duty to report any damage or defect in thechannel to the king, who would send orders to the local governorthat the necessary repairs should be put in hand. One of Hammurabi'sletters deals with the blocking of a canal at Erech, about which hehad received such reports. The dredging already undertaken had notbeen thoroughly done, so that the canal had soon silted up again andboats were prevented from reaching the city; in his letter Hammurabisent pressing orders that the canal was to be rendered navigablewithin three days.[27] Special regulations were also in force withregard to the respective responsibilities of boat-owners, boatmen andtheir clients. If a boatman hired a boat from its owner, he was heldresponsible for it, and had to replace it should it be lost or sunk;but if he refloated it, he had only to pay the owner half its valuefor the damage it had sustained. Boatmen were also responsible forthe safety of goods, such as corn, wool, oil or dates, which they hadundertaken to carry for hire, and they had to make good any total lossdue to their own carelessness. Collisions between two vessels were alsoprovided for, and should one of the boats have been moored at the time,the boatman of the other vessel had to pay compensation for the boatthat was sunk as well as for the lost cargo, the owner of the latterestimating its value upon oath. Many cases in the courts probably aroseout of loss or damage to goods in course of transport by water.The commercial activities of Babylon at the time of the First Dynastyled to a considerable growth in the size of the larger cities, whichceased to be merely local centres of distribution and began to engagein commerce farther afield. Between Babylonia and Elam close commercialrelations had long been maintained, but Hammurabi's western conquestsopened up new markets to the merchants of his capital. The greattrade-route up the Euphrates and into Syria was no longer blocked bymilitary outposts and fortifications, placed there in the vain attemptto keep back the invasion of Amorite tribes; and the trade in potterywith Carchemish, of which we have evidence under the later kings ofthe First Dynasty,[28] is significant of the new relations establishedbetween Babylonia and the West. The great merchants were, as a body,members of the upper class, and while they themselves continued toreside in Babylon, they employed traders who carried their goods abroadfor them by caravan.Even Hammurabi could not entirely guarantee the safety of such traders,for attacks by brigands were then as common in the Nearer East asat the present day; and there was always the additional risk that acaravan might be captured by the enemy, if it ventured too near ahostile frontier. In such circumstances the king saw to it that theloss of the goods was not borne by the agent, who had already riskedhis life and liberty in undertaking their transport. For, if such anagent had been forced in the course of his journey to give up some ofthe goods he was carrying, he had to specify the exact amount on oathon his return, and he was then acquitted of all responsibility. But ifit could be proved before the elders of the city that he had attemptedto cheat his employer by misappropriating money or goods to his ownuse, he was obliged to pay the merchant three times the value of thegoods he had taken. The law was not one-sided and afforded the agentequal protection in relation to his more powerful employer; for shouldthe latter be convicted of an attempt to defraud his agent, by denyingthat the due amount had been returned to him, he had to pay his agentas compensation six times the amount in dispute. The merchant alwaysadvanced the goods or money with which to trade, and the fact that hecould, if he wished to do so, fix his own profit at double the value ofthe capital, is an indication of the very satisfactory returns obtainedat this period from foreign commerce. But the more usual practice wasfor merchant and trader to share the profits between them, and, inthe event of the latter making such bad bargains that there was a losson his journey, he had to refund to the merchant the full value ofthe goods he had received. At the time of the First Dynasty asses anddonkeys were the beasts of burden employed for carrying merchandise,for the horse was as yet a great rarity and was not in general use inBabylonia until after the Kassite conquest.[29]A large number of the First Dynasty contracts relate to commercialjourneys of this sort, and record the terms of the bargains enteredinto between the interested parties. Such partnerships were sometimesconcluded for a single journey, but more often for longer periods oftime. The merchant always demanded a properly executed receipt forthe money or goods he advanced to the trader, and the latter receivedone for any deposit or pledge he might have made in token of his goodfaith. In reckoning their accounts on the conclusion of a journey, onlysuch amounts as were specified in the receipts were regarded as legalobligations, and, if either party had omitted to obtain his properdocuments, he did so at his own risk. The market-places of the capitaland the larger towns must have been the centres where such businessarrangements were transacted, and official scribes were probably alwaysin attendance to draw up the terms of any bargain in the presence ofother merchants and traders, who acted as witnesses. These had theirnames enumerated at the close of the document, and since they werechosen from local residents, some were always at hand to testify incase of any subsequent dispute.The town-life in Babylonia at this time must have had many features incommon with that of any provincial town in Mesopotamia to-day, exceptthat the paternal government of the First Dynasty undoubtedly saw to itthat the streets were kept clean, and made strenuous efforts to ensurethat private houses should be soundly built and maintained in properrepair. We have already followed out the lines of some of the streetsin ancient Babylon,[30] and noted that, while the foundations of thehouses were usually of burnt brick, crude brick was invariably employedfor their upper structure. They were probably all buildings of a singlestory, their flat mud roofs, supported on a layer of brush-wood withpoles for rafters, serving as a sleeping-place for their inmates duringthe hot season. Contemporary evidence goes to show that, before theperiod of Hammurabi, private houses had not been very solidly built,for his legislation contemplates the possibility of their fallingand injuring the inmates. In the case of new houses the law fixedthe responsibility upon the builder, and we may infer that the veryheavy penalties exacted for bad work led to a marked improvement inconstruction. For, when such a newly built house fell and crushed theowner so that he died, the builder himself was liable to be put todeath. Should the fall of the house kill the owner's son, the builder'sown son was slain; and, if one or more of the owner's slaves werekilled, the builder had to restore him slave for slave. Any damage tothe owner's possessions was also made good by the builder, who had inaddition to rebuild the house at his own cost, or repair any portionof it that had fallen. On the other hand, payment for sound work wasguaranteed, and the fact that the scale of payment was fixed by thearea of ground covered by the building, is direct evidence that thehouses of the period consisted of no more than one story. The beginningof town-planning on systematic lines, with streets running through andcrossing each other at right angles, of which we have noted evidence atBabylon, may perhaps date from the Hammurabi period; but no confidentopinion on the point can be expressed until further excavation has beenundertaken in the earlier strata of the city.[31][Illustration: I. A SMALL KELEK ON THE TIGRIS AT BAGHDAD. II.FERRY-BOATS ON THE EUPHRATES AT BIREJIK.]We have recovered from contemporary documents a very full pictureof family life in early Babylonia, for the duties of the separatemembers of a family to one another were regulated by law, andany change in relationship was duly attested and recorded in legalform before witnesses. Minute regulations were in force with regardto marriage, divorce and the adoption and maintenance of children,while the provision and disposal of marriage-portions, the rights ofwidows and the laws of inheritance were all controlled by the stateupon traditional lines. Perhaps the most striking feature in thesocial system was the recognized status of the wife in the Babylonianhousehold, and the extremely independent position enjoyed by womenin general. Any marriage to be legally binding had to be accompaniedby a duly executed and attested marriage-contract, and without thisnecessary preliminary a woman was not regarded as a wife in the legalsense. On the other hand, when once such a marriage-contract had beendrawn up and attested, its inviolability was stringently secured.Chastity on the wife's part was enforced under severe penalty;[32] buton the other hand the husband's responsibility to maintain his wife ina position suitable to their circumstances was also recognized.The law gave the wife ample protection, and in the case of thehusband's desertion allowed her, under certain conditions, to becomethe legal wife of another man. If the husband wilfully deserted herand left his city under no compulsion, she might remarry and he couldnot reclaim her on his return. But if his desertion was involuntary,as in the case of a man taken in battle and carried off as a prisoner,this rule did not apply; and the wife was allowed to shape her actionduring his absence in accordance with the condition of her husband'saffairs. The regulations in such a case were extraordinarily in favourof the woman. If the husband was possessed of property sufficient tomaintain the wife during the period of his captivity, she had no excusefor remarriage; and, should she become the wife of another man, themarriage was not regarded as legal and she was liable to the extremepenalty for adultery. But if the husband had not sufficient means forhis wife's maintenance, it was recognized that she would be thrown onher own resources, and she was permitted to remarry. The returningcaptive could claim his wife, but the children of the second marriageremained with their own father. The laws of divorce, too, safeguardedthe woman's interests, and only dealt with her severely if it couldbe proved that she had wasted her household and failed in her duty asa wife; in such a case she could be divorced without compensation,and even reduced to the condition of a slave in her husband's house.But, in the absence of such proof, her maintenance was fully secured;for the husband had to return her marriage-portion, and, if there hadbeen none, he must make her an allowance. She also had the custody ofher children, for whose maintenance and education the husband had toprovide; and, at his death, the divorced wife and her children couldinherit a share of his estate.[33] The contraction of a permanentdisease by the wife was also held to constitute no grounds for adivorce.Such regulations throw an interesting light on the position ofthe married woman in the Babylonian community, which was not onlyunexampled in antiquity but compares favourably, in point of freedomand independence, with her status in many countries of modern Europe.Still more remarkable were the privileges capable of attainment byunmarried women of the upper class, who in certain circumstances wereentitled to hold property in their own names and engage in commercialundertakings. To secure such a position a woman took vows, by which shebecame a member of a class of votaries attached to one of the chieftemples in Babylon, Sippar, or another of the great cities.[34] Theduties of such women were not sacerdotal, and, though they generallylived together, in a special building, or convent, attached to thetemple, they enjoyed a position of great influence and independence inthe community. A votary could possess property in her own name, and ontaking her vows was provided with a portion by her father, exactly asthough she were being given in marriage. This was vested in herself,and did not become the property of her order, nor of the temple towhich she was attached; it was devoted entirely to her maintenance, andafter her father's death, her brothers looked after her interest, andshe could farm the property out. Upon her death her portion returnedto her own family, unless her father assigned her the privilege ofbequeathing it; but any property she inherited she could bequeath, andshe had not to pay taxes on it. She had considerable freedom, couldengage in commerce on her own account, and, should she desire to do so,could leave, the convent and contract a form of marriage.While securing her these privileges, the vows she took entailedcorresponding responsibilities. Even when married, a votary was stillobliged to remain a virgin, and, should her husband desire children,she could not bear them herself, but must provide him with a maid orconcubine. But, in spite of this disability, she was secured in herposition as the permanent head of the household. The concubine, thoughshe might bear the husband children, was always the wife's inferior,and should she attempt to put herself on a level with the votary, thelatter could brand her and put her with the female slaves; while in theevent of the concubine proving barren, she could be sold. Unmarriedvotaries, too, could live in houses of their own and dispose of theirtime and money in their own way. But a high standard of commercialand social morality was expected from them, and severe penalties wereimposed for its infringement. No votary, for example, was permittedto open a beer-shop, and should she even enter one, she ran the riskof being put to death. An unmarried votary also enjoyed the statusof a married woman, and the penalty for slandering one was brandingin the forehead. That the social position enjoyed by a votary wasconsiderable is proved by the fact that many women of good family, andeven members of the royal house, took vows.It is a striking fact that women of an Eastern race should haveachieved such a position of independence at the beginning of the secondmillennium. The explanation is perhaps to be sought in the great partalready played by commerce in Babylonian life. Among contemporaryraces, occupied mainly by agriculture and war, woman's activity wasnecessarily restricted to the rearing of children and to the internaleconomy of the household. But with the growth of Babylonian trade andcommercial enterprise, it would seem that the demand arose, on thepart of women of the upper class, to take part in activities in whichthey considered themselves capable of joining.[35] The success of theexperiment was doubtless due in part to the high standard of moralityexacted, and in part to the prestige conferred by association with thereligious cult.The administration of justice at the period of the First Dynasty wascarried out by duly appointed courts of law under the supervision ofthe king. The judges were appointed by the crown, and a check was putupon any arbitrary administration of the law by the fact that theelders of the city sat with them and assisted them in hearing andsifting evidence. When once a judgment had been given and recorded, itwas irrevocable, and if any judge attempted to alter such a decision,he was expelled from his judgment-seat and debarred from exercisingjudicial functions in the future. The regulation was probably intendedto prevent the possibility of subsequent bribery; and, if a litigantconsidered that justice had not been done, it was always open to himto appeal to the king. Hammurabi's letters prove that he exercisedstrict supervision, not only over the cases decided in the capital,but also over those which were tried in the other great cities ofBabylonia, and it is clear that he attempted to stamp out corruptionon the part of all those invested with authority. On one occasion hehad been informed of a case of bribery in the town of Dûr-gurgurri,and he at once ordered the governor of the district to investigatethe charge and send the guilty parties to Babylon for punishment. Thebribe, too, was to be confiscated and despatched to Babylon under seal,a wise provision that would have tended to discourage those inclined totamper with the course of justice, while at the same time it enrichedthe state.[36] The king probably tried all cases of appeal in person,when it was possible; but in distant cities he deputed this duty tolocal officials. Many of the cases that came before him arose from theextortions of money-lenders,[37] and the king had no mercy when fraudon their part was proved.The relations maintained by the king with the numerous classes ofthe priesthood was also very close, and the control he exercisedover the chief priests and their subordinates appears to have beenas effective as that he maintained over the judicial authoritiesthroughout the country. Under the Sumerians there had always been atendency on the part of the more powerful members of the hierarchy tousurp the prerogatives of the crown,[38] but this danger appears tohave been fully discounted under the rule of the Western Semites. Oneimportant section of the priestly body were the astrologers, whoseduty it probably was to make periodical reports to the king on theconjunctions and movements of the heavenly bodies, with the object ofascertaining whether they portended good or evil to the state. Thelater Assyrian practice may well have had its origin at this period,and we may conclude that the regulation of the calendar was carried outin accordance with such advice. One of Hammurabi's letters has comedown to us in which he writes to inform Sin-idinnam, his local governorof Larsa, that it had been decided to insert an intercalary month inthe calendar. He writes that, as the year, that is the calendar, hada deficiency, the month that was beginning was to be registered asthe second Elul; and he adds the very practical reminder, that theinsertion of the extra month would not justify any postponement in thepayment of the regular tribute due from the city of Larsa.[39] Thelunar calendar of the Babylonians rendered the periodical intercalationof months necessary, in order that it should be made to correspond tothe solar year; and the duty of watching for the earliest appearance ofthe new moon and fixing the first day of each month, was among the mostimportant of the functions performed by the official astrologers.In the naming of the year the priesthood must also have played animportant part, since the majority of the events from which theyears were named were of a religious character. The system, whichwas inherited from the Sumerians, cannot have been a very convenientone,[40] and no doubt it owed its retention to the sanctity of thereligious rites and associations attaching to it. There can be littledoubt that, normally, the naming of the year took place at the NewYear's Feast, and, when the event commemorated in the formula was theinstallation of a chief priest or the dedication of temple-furniture,the royal act, we may assume, was performed on the day the yearwas named.[41] Often merely a provisional title was adopted fromthe preceding formula, and then perhaps no ceremony of naming washeld, unless in the course of it a great victory, or other importantoccurrence, was commemorated by the renaming of the year. The king musthave consulted with his priestly advisers before the close of the oldyear, and have settled on the new formula in good time to allow of itsannouncement in the outlying districts of the kingdom.Another important religious class at this period was the guild ofsoothsayers, and they also appear to have been directly under the royalcontrol. This we gather from a letter of Ammi-ditana, one of the laterkings of the First Dynasty, written to three high officials of Sippar,which illustrates the nature of their duties and the sort of occasionon which they were called upon to perform them.[42] It had come tothe king's knowledge that there was a scarcity of corn in Shagga,and since that town was in the administrative district of Sippar,he wrote to the officials concerned ordering them to send a supplythither. But, before the corn was brought into the city, they were toconsult the soothsayers, in order to ascertain whether the omens werefavourable. The method of inquiry is not specified, but it was probablyliver-divination, which was in common use during all periods.[43] Onlyif the omens proved favourable, was the corn to be brought into thetown, and Ave may conclude that the king took this precaution as hefeared that the scarcity of corn in Shagga was due to the anger of somelocal deity. The astrologers would be able to ascertain the facts, and,in the event of their reporting unfavourably, no doubt the services ofthe local priesthood would have been called in.We have already seen that flocks and herds which were owned by thegreat temples were sometimes pastured with those of the king, and thereis abundant evidence that the king also superintended the collectionof temple-revenues along with his own. Collectors of both secular andecclesiastical tribute sent reports directly to the king, and, if therewas any deficit in the supply expected from a collector, he had to makeit up himself. From one of Hammurabi's letters, for example, we gatherthat two landowners, or money-lenders, had lent money or advancedseed-corn to certain farmers near the towns of Dûr-gurgurri and Rakhabuand along the Tigris, and in settlement of their claims had seized thecrops, refusing to pay the proportion due to Bît-il-kittim, the greattemple of the Sun-god at Larsa. The governor of Larsa, the principalcity in the district, had rightly, as the representative of the palace,caused the tax-collector to make up the deficiency, but Hammurabi, onreceiving the subordinate officer's complaint, referred the matterback to the governor, and we may infer from similar cases that thedefaulting parties had to make good the loss and submit to fines orpunishment.[44] The document throws an interesting light on the methodsof government administration, and the manner in which the king gavepersonal supervision to the smallest details.It will be obvious that for the administration of the country a largebody of officials were required, and of their number two classes,of a semi-military character, enjoyed the king's special favour andprotection. They were placed in charge of public works and looked afterand controlled the public slaves, and they probably also had a gooddeal to do with the collection of the revenue. As payment for theirduties, they were each granted land with a house and garden; they wereassigned sheep and cattle to stock their land, and in addition theyReceived a regular salary. They were, in a sense, personal retainersof the king, and were liable to be sent at any moment on a specialmission. Disobedience was severely punished, for if such an officer,when detailed for special service, hired a substitute, he was liableto be put to death and the substitute could take his office. Sometimesan officer was sent to take charge of a distant garrison for a longperiod, and when this was done his home duties were performed byanother man, who temporarily occupied his house and land, and gaveit back to the officer on his return. If the officer had a son oldenough to perform the duty in his father's absence, he war allowed todo so; and, if he was too young, his maintenance was paid for out ofthe estate. Should the officer fail to arrange, before his departure,for the proper cultivation of his land and the discharge of his localduties, another could take his place after the lapse of a year, andon his return he could not reclaim his land or office. When on garrisonduty, or on special service, he ran the risk of capture by the enemy,and in that event his ransom was assured. For if his own means didnot suffice, the sum had to be paid from the treasury of the localtemple, and in the last resort by the state. It was specially enactedthat his land, garden, and house were in no case to be sold to payfor his ransom. They were inalienably attached to the office he held,which appears to have been entailed in the male line, since he wasprecluded from bequeathing any of the property to his wife or daughter.They could only pass from him and his male issue through neglect ordisobedience.[Illustration: IMPRESSIONS OF BABYLONIAN CILINDER SEALS. _Brit. Mus.,Nos._ 89771, 89388, 89110, 89367.]It is not improbable that the existence of this specially favouredclass of officer dates back to the earliest settlement of the WesternSemites in Babylonia. The first of their number may well have beenpersonal retainers and followers of Sumu-abum, the founder of thedynasty. Originally soldiers, they were probably assigned landsthroughout the country in return for their services to the king, andthey continued to serve him by maintaining order and upholding hisauthority. In the course of time specified duties were assigned tothem, but they retained their privileges, and they must have remaineda very valuable body of officers, on whose personal loyalty the kingcould always rely. In the case of war, they may have assisted inmobilization for the army was probably raised on a territorial basis,much on the lines of the _corvée_ for public works which was undertheir control.By contemporary documents of the period much light is thrown on otherclasses of the population, but, as they were all connected with variousdepartments in the commercial or agricultural life of the community,it will be unnecessary to describe them in further detail. One classperhaps deserves mention, the surgeons, since lack of professionalskill was rather heavily penalized. For if a surgeon, when called inby a noble, carried out an operation so unskilfully as to cause hisdeath or inflict a permanent injury upon him, such as the loss of aneye, the punishment was amputation of both hands. No penalty appearsto have been enacted if the patient were a member of the middle class,but should the slave of such a man die as the result of an operation,the surgeon had to give the owner another slave; and, in the event ofthe slave losing his eye, he had to pay the owner half the slave'svalue. There was, of course, no secular class in the population whichcorresponded to the modern doctor, for the medicinal use of herbs anddrugs was not separated from their employment in magic. Disease waslooked upon as due to the agency of evil spirits, or of those thatcontrolled them, and though many potions were doubtless drunk of acurative nature, they were taken at the instance of the magician,not of the doctor, and to the accompaniment of magical rites andincantations.[45]In the religious sphere, the rise of Babylon to the position ofcapital led to a number of important changes, and to a revision ofthe Babylonian pantheon. Marduk, the god of Babylon, from beinga comparatively obscure city-god, underwent a transformation inproportion to the increase in his city's importance. The achievementsand attributes of Enlil, the chief Sumerian deity, were ascribed tohim, and the old Sumerian sagas and legends, particularly those ofthe creation of the world, were rewritten in this new spirit by theBabylonian priesthood. The beginning of the process may be accuratelydated to the year of Hammurabi's conquest of Rîm-Sin and his subsequentcontrol of Nippur, the ancient centre of the old Sumerian faith. Itdoes not appear that the earlier Semites, when they conquered thatcity, had ever attempted to modify the old traditions they found there,or to appropriate them for their local gods. But a new spirit wasintroduced with the triumph of the Western Semites. The Sumerians werethen a dying race, and the gradual disappearance of their language asa living tongue was accompanied by a systematic translation, and apartial transformation, of their sacred literature. Enlil could not beentirely ousted from the position he had so long enjoyed, but Mardukbecame his greater son. The younger god is represented as winning hisposition by his own valour, in coming to the help of the older godswhen their very existence was threatened by the dragons of chaos; and,having slain the monster of the deep, he is portrayed as creatingthe universe from her severed body.[46] The older legends, no doubt,continued to be treasured in the ancient cult-centres of the land, butthe Babylonian versions, under royal sanction and encouragement, tendedto gain wide recognition and popularity.Under the later kings of the First Dynasty a great impetus was alsogiven to all branches of literary activity. The old Sumerian languagestill bulked largely in the phraseology of legal and commercialdocuments, as well as in the purely religious literature of thecountry. And, to aid them in their study of the ancient texts, theSemitic scribes undertook a systematic compilation of explanatorylists of words and ideograms--the earliest form of dictionary,--whichcontinued in use into the Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods. TheSumerian texts, too, were copied out and furnished with inter-linearSemitic translations. The astronomical and astrological studies andrecords of the Sumerian priests were taken over, and great collectionswere compiled in combination with the early Akkadian records thathad come down to them. A study of the Babylonian literature affordsstriking proof that the semitizing of the country led to no break, norset-back, in Babylonian culture. The older texts and traditions weretaken over in bulk, and, except where the rank or position of Mardukwas affected, little change or modification was made. The Semiticscribes no doubt developed their inheritance, but expansion took placeon the old lines.In commercial life, too, Sumerian customs remained to a great extentunaltered. Taxes, rent, and prices continued to be paid in kind, andthough the talent, maneh, and shekel were in use as metal weights, and;silver was in partial circulation, no true currency was developed. Inthe sale of land, for example, even during the period of the Kassitekings, the purchase-price was settled in shekel-weights of silver, butvery little metal actually changed hands. Various items were exchangedagainst the land, and these, in addition I to corn, the principalmedium of exchange, included slaves, animals, weapons, garments, etc.,the value of each item being reckoned on the same silver basis, untilthe agreed purchase-price was made up. The early Semitic Babylonian,despite his commercial activity, did not advance beyond the transitionstage between pure barter and a regular currency.One important advantage conferred by the Western Semite on the countryof his adoption was an increase in the area of its commercial relationsand a political expansion to the north and west. He systematized itslaws, and placed its internal administration on a wider--and moreuniform basis. But the greatest and most far-reaching change of theHammurabi period was that the common speech of the whole of Babyloniabecame Semitic, as did the dominant racial element in the population.And it was thanks to this fact that all subsequent invasions of thecountry failed to alter the main features in her civilization. Suchalien strains were absorbed in process of time, and, though theyundoubtedly introduced fresh blends into the racial mixture, theSemitic element triumphed, and continued to receive reinforcementsfrom the parent stock. The Sumerian race and language appear to havesurvived longest in the extreme south of the country, and we shall seethat the rise of the Sea-Country kings may perhaps be regarded as theirlast effective effort in the political sphere.[Footnote 1: The Code was first published and translated by Scheil,in the "Mémoires de la Délégation en Perse," Vol. IV.

The proud phraseology of the Prologue tohis Code conveys the impression that the empire was solidly compact,and its component cities the willing recipients of his royal clemencyand favour. And there can be no doubt that he owed his success ingreat measure to the efficient administration he had established underhis personal control. His son, Samsu-iluna, inherited his father'straditions, and in his letters that have survived we have abundantevidence that he exercised the same close supervision over the judicialand administrative officers stationed in cities distant from thecapital. And it would appear that the first eight years of his reignpassed under the same peaceful conditions, that had prevailed at thetime of his accession to the throne. He cut two canals, and the nameshe gave them commemorate the wealth and abundance he hoped by theirmeans to bestow upon the people. It was in his third and fourth yearsthat the Samsu-iluna-nagab-nukhush-nishi and the Samsu-iluna-khegallumCanals were completed, and the royal activities were then confined tothe further adornment of the great temples of Babylon and Sippar. Hisninth year marks the crisis, not only in Samsu-iluna's own reign, butin the early fortunes of the kingdom. It is then that we first hear ofKassite tribes appearing in force upon Babylon's eastern frontier, and,though Samsu-iluna doubtless defeated them, as he claims to have done,it is clear that their emergence from the foothills of Western Elam,followed speedily by their penetration of Babylonian territory, was thesignal for setting the empire in a blaze.They must have met with some success before their onslaught wasarrested by the army sent against them,[1] and the renewal ofhostilities in any form must have aroused once more the fightinginstinct of the Elamite border tribes, which had been temporarily laidto rest by Hammurabi's victories. Hammurabi's old antagonist, Rîm-Sinhimself, had long been living in comparative retirement, and, in spiteof his advanced age, the news fired him to fresh efforts. His name wasstill on the lips of those who had fought under him, and since thedeath of his conqueror, Hammurabi, his prestige must have tended toincrease. When, therefore, his native land of Emutbal, allying itselfwith the neighbouring Elamite district of Idamaraz, followed up theKassite onslaught by an organized invasion, Rîm-Sin raised a revoltin Southern Babylonia, and succeeded in gaining possession of Erechand Nîsin. It would appear that the Babylonian garrison in Larsa, too,was overcome, and that the city passed once more under the independentcontrol of its old ruler.With the whole south of the country in arms against him, we mayconjecture that Samsu-iluna detailed sufficient forces to containRîm-Sin, while he dealt with the invasion of Babylon's home-territory.He had little difficulty in disposing of the Elamites, and, marchingsouthwards, he defeated Rîm-Sin's forces and reoccupied Larsa.[2]It may be that it was at this time he captured, or burnt, Rîm-Sinalive,[3] and that the palace where this took place was therebel leader's old palace at Larsa, which he had been making hisheadquarters. But the revolt was not completely subdued. Ur andErech still held out, and it was only after a further campaign thatSamsu-iluna recaptured them and razed their walls. He had thussucceeded in crushing the first series of organized attacks uponthe empire, but the effort of dealing simultaneously with invasionand internal revolt had evidently strained the national resources.Garrisons had probably been reduced in distant provinces, others hadbeen cut down in order to reinforce his armies in the field, and it isnot surprising that in his twelfth year these outlying districts shouldhave followed the prevailing lead. In that year it is recorded that allthe lands revolted against him.[4][Illustration: IMPRESSIONS OF KASSITE CILINDER SEALS. _Brit. Mus.,Nos._ 89128, 89001, 28799, 89240, 89258.]We may with some confidence trace the main source of Samsu-iluna'sfresh troubles to the action of Iluma-ilum, who, probably at this time,headed a revolt in the Sea-Country on the shore of the Persian Gulf,and declared his independence of Babylon. Samsu-iluna's answer was toraise further levies and lead them against his new foe. The subsequentbattle was fiercely contested on the very shore of the Gulf, for alater chronicler records that the bodies of the slain were carriedoff by the sea; yet it was either indecisive, or resulted in thediscomfiture of the Babylonians. We may conjecture that the king wasprevented from employing his full forces to stamp out the rebellion,in consequence of trouble in other quarters. For in the followingtwo years we find him destroying the cities Kisurra and Sabum, anddefeating the leader of a rebellion in the home-territory of Babylonitself.[5]Iluma-ilum was thus afforded the opportunity of consolidating hisposition, and we may perhaps see evidence of his growing influencein Southern Babylonia in the fact that at Tell Ṣifr not a singledocument has been found dated in a later year of Samsu-iluna's reignthan the tenth.[6] In view of the fact that the central city of Nippureventually passed under Iluma-ilum's control, we may probably assumethat he was already encroaching northwards, and that territory inthe south of Sumer, perhaps including the city of Larsa, passed nowinto his possession. In support of this suggestion it may be notedthat, when Samsu-iluna, after suppressing the Akkadian usurper, beganrepairing the damage wrought in six years of continuous fighting, itis at Nîsin and at Sippar that he rebuilds the ruined walls, and inEmutbal that he repairs the great garrison-fortresses. Nîsin may wellhave marked the most southerly limit of Babylon's control, and we maypicture the gradual expansion of the Sea-Country, as the power ofBabylon declined. The "rebellious land," which Samsu-iluna boasts thathe overthrew in his twentieth year, was perhaps the Sea-Country, for weknow that he conducted a second campaign against Iluma-ilum, who thistime secured a victory. If the Babylonian army succeeded in retreatingin comparatively good order, it would have formed a sufficientjustification for Samsu-iluna's boast that he had given the rebelliousland a lesson.The fringe of territory in the extreme south-east of Babylonia alwaysexhibited a tendency to detach itself from the upper riverain districtsof Babylonia proper. Forming the littoral of the Persian Gulf, andencroaching in its northern area upon Elam, it consisted of greatstretches of rich alluvial soil interspersed with areas of marsh-landand swamps, which tended to increase where the rivers approached thecoast. The swamps undoubtedly acted as a protection to the country,for while tracks and fords were known to the inhabitants, a strangerfrom the north-west would in many places have been completely baffledby them. The natives, too, in their light reed-boats could escape fromone district to another, pushing along known passages and eluding theirpursuers, when once the tall reeds had closed behind them. The laterAssyrians at the height of their power succeeded in subduing a seriesof revolts in the Sea-Country, but it was only by enlisting the helpof native guides and by commandeering the light canoes of neighbouringvillages. The earlier kings of Babylonia had always been content toleave the swamp-dwellers to themselves, and at most to exact a nominalrecognition of suzerainty. But it is probable that fresh energy hadbeen lately introduced into the district, and of this Iluma-ilumdoubtless took advantage when he succeeded, not only in leading arevolt, but in establishing an independent kingdom.[Illustration: FIG. 44.SWAMP IN SOUTHERN BABYLONIA OR THE SEA-COUNTRY.An Assyrian conquest of the country is here represented, amid all thedifficulties presented by its swamps and reed-beds.(After a bas-relief at Nineveh.)]It is clear that the pressure exerted upon Babylonia by theWest-Semitic migration must have tended to displace sections of theexisting population. The direction of advance was always down-stream,and the pressure continued in force even after the occupation ofthe country. Those strains in the population, which differed mostradically from the invaders, would be the more likely to seek sanctuaryelsewhere, and, with the exception of Elam, the Sea-Country offeredthe only possible line of retreat. We may assume, therefore, that themarsh-dwellers of the south had been reinforced for a considerableperiod by Sumerian refugees, and, though the first three rulers of thenew kingdom bore Semitic names and were probably Semites, the namesof later rulers of the Sea-Country suggest that the Sumerian elementin the population afterwards secured the control,[7] no doubt withthe assistance of fresh drafts from their own kindred after theirsuccessful occupation of Southern Babylonia. Under the more powerfulkings of the Second Dynasty, the kingdom may have assumed a characterresembling that of its predecessors in Babylonia. The centre ofadministration was certainly shifted for a time to Nippur, and possiblyeven further north, but the Sea-Country, as the home-land of thedynasty, must have always been regarded as a dominant province of thekingdom, and it offered a secure refuge to its rulers in the event oftheir being driven again within its borders. In spite of its extensivemarshes, it was capable of sustaining its inhabitants in a considerabledegree of comfort, for the date-palm flourished luxuriantly, and theareas under cultivation must have been at least as productive as thosefurther to the north-west. Moreover, the zebu, or humped cattle ofSumer, thrived in the swamps and water-meadows, and not only formedan important source of supply, but were used for ploughing in theagricultural districts.[8]With such a country as a base of operations, protected in no smalldegree by its marshes, it is not surprising that the Sea-Country kingsshould have met with considerable success in their efforts at extendingthe area of territory under their control.After his second conflict with Iluma-ilum, Samsu-iluna appears tohave reconciled himself to the loss of his southern province, and tohave made no further effort at reconquest. He could still boast ofsuccesses in other districts, for he destroyed the walls of Shakhnâand Zarkhanum, doubtless after the suppression of a revolt, and hestrengthened the fortifications of Kish. He also retained the controlof the Euphrates route to Syria, and he doubtless encouraged thecommercial enterprise of Babylon in that direction as a set-off to hislosses in the south. We possess an interesting illustration of theclose relations he maintained with the west in the date-formula forthe twenty-sixth year of his reign, which tells us that he procureda monolith from the great mountain of the land of Amurru. This musthave been quarried in the Lebanon, and transported overland to theEuphrates, and thence conveyed by _kelek_ to the capital. From thedetails he gives us of its size, it appears to have measured somethirty-six feet in length, and it was no small achievement to havebrought it so far to Babylon.[Illustration: FIG. 45.THE ZEBU OR HUMPED OXEN OF THE SEA-COUNTRY.They are here represented as being driven off from the Soa-Country,along with other booty, under a convoy of Assyrian soldiers.(After a bas-relief from Nineveh in the British Museum.)]During this period of comparative tranquillity Samsu-iluna devotedhimself once more to rebuilding and beautifying E-sagila and thetemples of Kish and Sippar; but in his twenty-eighth year Babylonsuffered a fresh shock, which appears to have resulted in stillfurther loss of territory. In that year he claims to have slainIadi-khabum and Muti-khurshana, two leaders of an invasion, or arevolt, of which we have no details. But it is clear that the victory,if such it was, resulted in further trouble, for in the followingtwo years no fresh date-formulæ were promulgated, and it is probablethat the king himself was absent from the capital. It is significantthat no document has been recovered at Nippur which is dated afterSamsu-iluna's twenty-ninth year, although in the preceding period, fromthe thirty-first year of Hammurabi onward, when the city first passedinto Babylon's possession, nearly every year is well represented in thedated series.[9] It is difficult not to conclude that Samsu-iluna nowlost the control of that city, and, since one of the documents fromNippur is dated in Iluma-ilum's reign, it can only have passed into thelatter's possession. Further evidence of the diminishing territory ofBabylon may be seen in the fact that Samsu-iluna should have rebuiltthe old line of fortresses, founded by his ancestor Suma-la-ilumat a time when the kingdom was in its infancy.[10] This work wasdoubtless undertaken when he foresaw the necessity of defending theAkkadian border, and he must have lost one at least of the fortresses,Dûr-Zakar, when Nippur was taken. His activities during his closingyears were confined to the north and west, and to the task of keepingopen the Euphrates route. For he cut a canal beside Kâr-Sippar,recovered possession of Saggaratum, and probably destroyed the citiesof Arkum and Amal. His defeat of an Amorite force some two yearsbefore his death is of interest as proving that the Western Semitesof Akkad, nearly two centuries after their settlement in the country,were experiencing the same treatment from their own stock that theythemselves had caused to the land of their adoption.Samsu-iluna, with the possible exception of Ammi-ditana, was thelast great king of the West-Semitic dynasty. It is true that his sonAbi-eshu' made a fresh attempt to dislodge Iluma-ilum from his holdupon Central and Southern Babylonia. A late chronicle records that hetook the offensive and marched against Iluma-ilum.[11] It would seemthat his attack was in the nature of a surprise, and that he succeededin cutting off the king and part of his forces, possibly on theirreturn from some other expedition. It is clear that he came into touchwith him in the neighbourhood of the Tigris, and probably forced him totake refuge in a fortress, since he attempted to cut off his retreat bydamming the river. He is said to have succeeded in damming the stream,but he failed to catch Iluma-ilum. The chronicle records no furtherconflict between the two, and we may assume that he then adopted hisfather's later policy of leaving the Sea-Country in possession of itsconquered territory. In some of his broken date-formulæ we have echoesof a few further campaigns, and we know that he cut the Abi-eshu'Canal, and built a fortress at the gate of the Tigris, which he alsonamed after himself, Dûr-Abi-eshu'. This was probably a frontierfortification, erected for the defence of the river at the point whereit passed from Babylon's area of control to that of the Sea-Country. Healso built the town of Lukhaia on the Arakhtu Canal in the immediateneighbourhood of Babylon. But both Abi-eshu' and his successors onthe throne give evidence of having become more and more engrossed incult-observances. The supply of temple-furniture begins to have forthem the importance that military success had for their fathers. And itis a symptom of decadence that, even in the religious sphere, they areas much concerned with their own worship as with that of the gods.It is significant that Abi-eshu' should have named one of his yearsof rule by his decoration of a statue of Entemena, the early patesiof Lagash, who had been accorded divine honours, and, at some periodafter Hammurabi's occupation of that city, had received a cult-centreof his own in Babylon. For the act indicates an increased interest,on Abi-eshu's part, in the deification of royalty. This honour waspeculiarly associated with the possession of Nippur, the central cityand shrine of the country, and Babylon had adopted the practice ofdeification for her kings after Nippur had been annexed by Hammurabi.Though the city had now passed from Babylon's control, Abi-eshu'did not relinquish the privilege his father and grandfather hadlegitimately enjoyed. Since Babylon no longer possessed the centralshrine of Enlil, in which his own divine statue should have been setup, he dedicated one in Enlil's local temple at Babylon. But notcontent with that he fashioned no less than five other statues ofhimself, which he set up in the temples of other gods, at Babylon,Sippar and elsewhere.[12]His three successors followed the same practice, and Ammi-ditana andAmmi-zaduga, his son and grandson, have left descriptions of some ofthese cult-images of themselves.[13] A favourite character, in whichthe king was often represented, was holding a lamb for divination, andanother was in the attitude of prayer. The later kings of the FirstDynasty love, too, to dwell on their sumptuous votive offerings.Marduk is supplied with innumerable weapons of red gold, and theSun-god's shrine at Sippar is decorated with solar disks of precious_dushû_-stone, inlaid with red gold, lapis-lazuli, and silver. Greatreliefs, with representations of rivers and mountains, were castin bronze and set up in the temples; and Samsu-ditana, the last ofhis line, records among his offerings to the gods the dedication toSarpanitum of a rich silver casket for perfumes.Incidentally, these references afford striking proof of the wealthBabylon had now acquired, due no doubt to her increased commercialactivities. Elam on the one side and Syria on the other[14] hadfurnished her with imports of precious stone, metal, and wood; andher craftsmen had learnt much from foreign teachers. In spite of thecontraction of Hammurabi's empire, the life of the people in boththe town and country districts of Akkad was not materially altered.The organized supervision of all departments of national activity,pastoral, agricultural and commercial, which the nation owed ingreat measure to Hammurabi, was continued under these later kings;and some of the royal letters that have been recovered show thatorders on comparatively unimportant matters continued to be issued inthe king's name. We know, too, of a good many public works carriedout by Ammi-ditana, Abi-eshu's son. He cut only one canal, and hebuilt fortresses for the protection of others, and named them alterhimself. Thus, in addition to the Ammi-ditana Canal, we learn of aDûr-Ammi-ditana, which he erected on the Zilakum Canal, and anotherfortress of the same name on the Mê-Enlil Canal. He strengthenedthe wall of Ishkun-Marduk, which was also on the Zilakum, and builtMashkan-Ammi-ditana and the wall of Kâr-Shamash, both on the bank ofthe Euphrates.[15]The systematic fortification of the rivers and canals may perhapsbe interpreted as marking an advance of the frontier southward, inconsequence of which it was advisable to protect the crops and thewater-supply of the districts thus recovered from the danger of suddenraids. On two occasions Ammi-ditana claims, in rather vague terms, tohave freed his land from danger, once by restoring the might of Marduk,and later on by loosing the pressure from his land; and that, in hisseventeenth year, he should have claimed to have conquered Arakhab,perhaps referred to as "the Sumerian,"[16] is an indication that theSea-Country kings found ready assistance from the older populationof the South. Moreover, of the later West-Semitic kings, Ammi-ditanaalone appears to have made headway against the encroachments of theSea-Country. The most conclusive proof of his advance is to be seenin the date-formula for his thirty-seventh year, which records thathe destroyed the wall of Nîsin,[17] proving that he had penetrated tothe south of Nippur. That Nippur itself was held by him for a time ismore than probable, especially as one of his building-inscriptions,still unpublished, is said to have been found there[18]; and we knowalso, from a Neo-Babylonian copy of a similar text, that he claimed thetitle "King of Sumer and Akkad."[19] Under him, then, Babylon recovereda semblance of her former strength, but we may conjecture that theSea-Country retained its hold on Larsa and the southern group of cities.We are furnished with a third valuable synchronism between thedynasties of Babylon and of the south by the reference to Ammi-ditana'sdestruction of the wall of Nîsin, for the date-formula adds that thishad been erected by the people of Damiḳ-ilishu. The ruler referredto is obviously the third king in the dynasty of the Sea-Country,who succeeded Itti-ili-nibi upon the throne.[20] We may concludethat it was in his reign, or shortly after it, that Ammi-ditanasucceeded in recovering Nîsin, after having already annexed Nippur onhis southward advance. In his thirty-fourth year, two years beforethe capture of Nîsin, he had dedicated an image of Samsu-iluna inthe temple E-namtila, and we may perhaps connect this tribute to hisgrandfather with the fact that in his reign Babylon had last enjoyedthe distinction conferred by the suzerainty of Nippur.In the year following the recovery of Nîsin Ammi-zaduga succeededhis father on the throne, and since he ascribes the greatness of hiskingdom to Enlil, and not to Marduk or any other god, we may seein this a further indication that Babylon continued to control hisancient shrine. But the remaining date-formulæ for Ammi-zaduga's reigndo not suggest that Ammi-ditana's conquests were held permanently.A succession of religious dedications is followed in his tenth yearby the conventional record that he loosed the pressure of his land,suggesting that his country had been through a period of conflict; and,though in the following year he built a fortress, Dûr-Ammi-zaduga "atthe mouth of the Euphrates," the nearly unbroken succession of votiveacts, commemorated during his remaining years and in the reign of hisson Samsu-ditana, makes it probable that the kings of Sea-Country weregradually regaining some of the territory they had temporarily lost.[21]But it was not from the Sea-Country that the West-Semitic Dynasty ofBabylon received its death-blow. In the late chronicle, which hasthrown so much light on the earlier conflicts of this troubled period,we read of another invasion, which not only brought disaster to Babylonbut probably put an end to her first dynasty. The chronicler statesthat during the reign of Samsu-ditana, the last king of the dynasty,"men of the land of Khatti marched against the land of Akkad," in otherwords, that Hittites from Anatolia[22] marched down the Euphrates andinvaded Babylonia from the north-west. The chronicle does not recordthe result of the invasion,[23] but we may probably connect it with thefact that the Kassite king Agum-kakrime brought back to Babylon fromKhanî, the old Khana on the middle Euphrates,[24] the cult-images ofMarduk and Sarpanitum and installed them once more with great pomp andceremony within their shrines in E-sagila. We may legitimately concludethat they were carried off by the Hittites during their invasion inSamsu-ditana's reign.[Illustration: BRICK OF SIN-GASHID, KING OF ERECH, RECORDING THEBUILDING OF HIS PALACE IN THAT CITY. _From Warka; Brit. Mus._, No.90268; _Photo by Messrs. Mansell & Co._]If the Hittites succeeded in despoiling Babylon of her most sacreddeities, it is clear that they must have raided the city, and they mayeven have occupied it for a time. Thus the West-Semitic Dynasty ofBabylon may have been brought to an end by these Hittite conquerors,and Samsu-ditana himself may have fallen in defence of his own capital.But there is no reason for supposing that the Hittites occupiedBabylon for long. Even if their success was complete, they would soonhave returned to their own country, laden with heavy spoil; and theydoubtless left some of their number in occupation of Khana on theirwithdrawal up the Euphrates. Southern Babylonia may also have sufferedin the raid, but we may assume that its force was felt most in thenorth, and that the kings of the Sea-Country profited by the disaster.We have as yet no direct evidence of their occupation of Babylon, but,as their kingdom had been Babylon's most powerful rival prior to theHittite raid, it may well have increased its borders after her fall.To this period we may probably assign a local dynasty of Erech,represented by the names of Sin-gashid, Sin-gamil and An-am. Frombricks and foundation-records recovered at Warka, the site of theancient city, we know that the first of these rulers restored the oldtemple of E-anna and built himself a new palace.[25] But the mostinteresting of Sin-gashid's records is a votive cone, commemoratingthe dedication of E-kankal to Lugal-banda and the goddess Ninsun, for,when concluding his text with a prayer for abundance, he inserts alist or tariff, stating the maximum-price which he had fixed for thechief articles of commerce during his reign,[26] Sin-gamil was An-am'simmediate predecessor on the throne of Erech, and during his reignthe latter dedicated on his behalf a temple to Nergal in the townof Usipara.[27] An-am was the son of a certain Bêl-shemea, and hisprincipal work was the restoration of the wall of Erech, the foundationof which he ascribes to the semi-mythical ruler Gilgamesh.[28]Doubtless other local kingdoms arose during the period followingBabylon's temporary disappearance as a political force, but we haverecovered no traces of them,[29] and the only fact of which we arecertain is the continued succession of the Sea-Country kings. To oneof these rulers, Gulkishar, reference is made upon a boundary stoneof the twelfth century, drawn up in the reign of Enlil-nadin-apli, anearly king of the Fourth Dynasty. On it he is given the title of Kingof the Sea-Country, which is also the late chronicler's designationfor E-gamil, the last member of the dynasty, in the account he hasleft us of the Kassite invasion. Such evidence seems to show that theadministrative centre of their rule was established at those periods inthe south; but the inclusion of the dynasty in the Kings' List is bestexplained on the assumption that at least some of its later membersimposed their suzerainty over a wider area.[30] They were evidentlythe only stable line of rulers in a period after the most powerfuladministration the country had yet known had been suddenly shattered.The land had suffered much, not only from the Hittite raid, but alsoduring the continuous conflicts of more than a century that precededthe final fall of Babylon. It must have been then that many of theold Sumerian cities of Southern and Central Babylonia were deserted,after being burned down and destroyed; and they were never afterwardsre-occupied. Lagash, Umma, Shuruppak, Kisurra and Adab play no part inthe subsequent history of Babylonia.Of the fortunes of Babylon at this time we know nothing, but the factthat the Kassites should have made the city their capital shows thatthe economic forces, which had originally raised her to that position,were still in operation. The Sumerian elements in the population ofSouthern Babylonia may now have enjoyed a last period of influence,and their racial survival in the Sea-Country may in part explain itscontinual striving for independence. But in Babylonia as a whole theeffects of three centuries of West-Semitic rule were permanent. When,after the Kassite conquest, Babylon emerges once more into view, itis apparent that the traditions inherited from her first empire haveundergone small change.[Footnote 1: We may assume that they owed the partial success of theraid to their mobility, although on this occasion, their earliestinvasion of Babylonian territory, the horse probably played a stillmore useful part in the retreat; see further, p. 215 f.][Footnote 2: Such appears to be the most probable explanation ofthe duplicate copies of the sale-contract from Tell Ṣifr, in theneighbourhood of Larsa, with their variant dates by formulæ of Rîm-Sinand Samsu-iluna; see above, p. 98.][Footnote 3: Cf. "Chronicles concerning early Babylonian Kings," II.,p. 18.][Footnote 4: Cf. the date-formula for Samsu-iluna's twelfth year, whichin its full form commemorated some royal act "after all the lands hadrevolted." Since the success against Ur and Erech was commemorated inthe preceding year, the revolt in question can hardly refer to thetroubles with Rîm-Sin and the Elamites, but must be taken as implyingthat other provinces were now making a bid for independence.][Footnote 5: The formula for his fourteenth year commemorates hisoverthrow of "the usurping king, whom the Akkadians had caused to leada rebellion."][Footnote 6: The latest document from Larsa (Senkera) is dated in histwelfth year; see above, p. 104 f.][Footnote 7: Such names as Ishkibal, Gulkishar, Peshgal-daramash,A-dara-kalama, Akur-ul-ana and Melam-kurkura are all Sumerian. The lastking of the dynasty, Ea-gamil, bears a Semitic name, and Shushshi, thename of Ishkibal's brother, is probably Semitic.][Footnote 8: The zebu, or _Bos indicus,_ is represented on Sumeriansculpture from Lagash, dating from the middle of the third millenniumB.C. (cf. "Sumer and Akkad, p. 69, Fig. 21); men are representedploughing with it in a Kassite seal-impression (see above, p. 175 Fig.40); and it formed one of the most valued classes of booty from theSea-Country at the time of the later Assyrian empire (see Fig. 45).][Footnote 9: Cf. Poebel, "Legal and Business Documents," p. 119; andChiera, "Legal and Administrative Documents," p. 25.][Footnote 10: See above, p. 148 f.][Footnote 11: Cf. "Chronicles concerning Early Kings," II., p. 21.][Footnote 12: One of these statues was set up in E-gishshirgal, a namewhich corresponds to that of the old Moon-temple at Ur; and on thisevidence Poebel has assumed that Abi-eshu' succeeded in getting controlof Southern Babylonia (cf. "Legal and Business Documents," p. 120). Buta fuller form of the date has since been recovered, showing that thisE-gishshirgal, and doubtless the temple of Enlil coupled with it, werein Babylon. It would seem therefore that after Samsu-iluna had losthis hold upon the great centre of the Moon-cult in the south, a localtemple for the Moon-god's worship was established at Babylon, under theancient name, in which the old cult-practices were reproduced as faras possible. Similarly, having lost Nippur, a new shrine to Enlil wasbuilt at Babylon, or an old one enlarged and beautified. By such meansit was doubtless hoped to secure a continuance of the gods' favour, andan ultimate recovery of their cities; and the continual dedication ofroyal images, though doubtless a sign of royal deification, must alsohave been intended to bring the king's claims to the divine notice.][Footnote 13: As Ammi-ditana appears to have recovered Nippur fora time towards the end of his reign, and as Ammi-zaduga probablyretained it during his earlier years (see below, p. 208 f.), Babyloncould legitimately claim her former privileges during the period ofoccupation.][Footnote 14: The bronze-casting may well have been learnt fromElam; and we have striking evidence of increased relations withthe west in the fact that under Ammi-zaduga a district of Sipparwas known as Amurrî, from its Amorite quarter or settlement; cf.Meissner, "Altbabylonisches Privatrecht," p. 41 f., No. 42, and Meyer,"Geschichte," I., ii., p. 467 f.][Footnote 15: His other building activities included the founding of aroyal suburb at Babylon, named Shag-dugga, on the bank of the ArakhtuCanal, where he built himself a palace; while at Sippar he once morerebuilt the Gagûm, or spacious Cloister attached to the temple of theSun-god.][Footnote 16: Cf. Poebel, "Legal and Business Documents," p. 121, andSchorr, "Urkunden," p. 602.][Footnote 17: For references, see Schorr, _op. cit.,_ p. 604.][Footnote 18: According to a verbal communication made by Prof.Hilprecht to Dr. Poebel.][Footnote 19: Cf. "Letters and Inscriptions of Hammurabi," III., p. 207f.; in the same inscription he also lays claim to the rule of Amurru.][Footnote 20: It is most improbable that he should be identifiedwith Damiḳ-ilishu, the last king of the earlier Dynasty of Nîsin,who perished one hundred and thirty-seven years before this time.It is true that Nabonidus, to judge from his building-inscriptions,evinces an interest in the past, but in many ways he was a uniquemonarch and he lived in a later age. These early date-formulæ, on theother hand, always refer to contemporaneous events, not to matters ofarchæological interest. We know definitely that Iluma-ilum (the firstSea-Country king) was the contemporary of Samsu-iluna and Abi-eshu',and it is not unreasonable to find a reference to Damiḳ-ilishu (thethird Sea-Country king) in the last year of Ammi-ditana, Abi-eshu'sson. Granting this assumption, there follows the important inferencethat the exceptionally long period of one hundred and fifteen years,assigned by the Kings' List to the reigns of the first two kings ofthe Sea-Country, is a little exaggerated. The accuracy of some of thelonger figures assigned in the List to kings of this dynasty has longbeen called in question (cf. "Chronicles," I., pp. 111 ff., and seeabove, p. 106), and the synchronism justifies this doubt. While thehistorical character of the Second Dynasty has been amply confirmed, wemust not regard the total duration assigned to it in the Kings' Listas more than approximately correct. Under these circumstances detaileddates have not been assigned to members of that dynasty in the DynasticList of Kings; see Appendix II., p. 320.][Footnote 21: Success doubtless fluctuated from one side to theother, Ammi-zaduga in one of his later years commemorating that hehad brightened his land like the Sun-god, and Samsu-ditana recordingthat he had restored his dominion with the weapon of Marduk. How farthese rather vague claims were justified it is impossible to say. Apartfrom votive acts, the only definite record of this period is that ofAmmi-zaduga's sixteenth year, in which he celebrates the cutting of theAmmi-zaduga-nukhush-nishi Canal.][Footnote 22: We may confidently regard the phrase as referring tothe Anatolian Hittites, whose capital at Boghaz Keui must have beenfounded far earlier than the end of the fifteenth century when weknow that it bore the name of Khatti. It is true that, after thesouthern migration of the Hittites in the twelfth century, NorthernSyria was known as "the land of Khatti," but, if the invasion ofBabylonia in Samsu-ditana's reign had been made by Semitic tribesfrom Syria, no doubt the chronicler would have employed the correctdesignation, Amurru, which is used in an earlier section of the textfor Sargon's invasion of Syria. In the late omen-literature, too, theuse of the early geographical terms is not confused. Both chroniclesand omen-texts are transcripts of early written originals, not latecompilations based on oral tradition.][Footnote 23: The reason for the omission is that the whole of thissection of the text had evidently been left out by the scribe inerror, and he afterwards only had room to insert the first line; cf."Chronicles," II., p. 22, n. 1.][Footnote 24: This district was in the path of the Hittite raid,and its occupation by a section of the invaders was evidently morepermanent than that of Babylon.][Footnote 25: Cf.

The purchasing power ofone shekel of silver is fixed at three _gur_ of corn, or twelve manehsof wool, or ten manehs of copper, or thirty _ḳa_ of wood. The chiefinterest of the record is its proof that at this period the values ofcopper and silver stood in the ratio of 600:1 (cf. Meyer, "Geschichte,"I., ii., p. 512).][Footnote 27: Cf. "Cun.

A tablet has been recovered dated in the reign of An-am, andanother of the same type is dated in the reign of Arad-shasha, whom wemay therefore regard as another king of this local dynasty; cf. Scheil,"Orient. Lit.-Zeit.," 1905, col. 351, and Thureau-Dangin, _op. cit.,_p. 238. The style of writing on these tablets is rather later than thatof the First Dynasty of Babylon.][Footnote 29: For Pukhia, son of Asiru and king of the land ofKhurshitu, see "Sum. and Akk.," p. 287. Khurshitu may have been thename of a district on the Ak-su, a tributary of the Adhem, since abrick from his palace is said to have been found at Tuz-khurmati onthat stream; cf. Scheil, "Rec. de trav.," XVI., p. 186; XIX., p. 64.The region of King Manabaltel's rule (cf. Pinches, "Proc. Soc. Bibl.Arch.," XXI., p. 158) is quite uncertain, but the archaic style ofthe writing of the tablet, dated in his reign, suggests that he was acontemporary of one of the earlier West-Semitic kings.][Footnote 30: See above, p. 105 f.]CHAPTER VIITHE KASSITE DYNASTY AND ITS RELATIONS WITH EGYPT AND THE HITTITE EMPIREThe Kassite conquest of Babylonia, though it met with immediate successin a great part of the country, was a gradual process in the south,being carried out by independent Kassite chieftains. The Sea-Countrykings continued for a time their independent existence; and even afterthat dynasty was brought to an end, the struggle for the south went on.It was after a further period of conflict that the Kassite dominationwas completed, and the administration of the whole country centredonce more in Babylon. It is fortunate for Babylonia that the newinvaders did not appear in such numbers as to over-whelm the existingpopulation. The probability has long been recognized that they wereAryan by race, and we may with some confidence regard them as akin tothe later rulers of Mitanni, who imposed themselves upon the earliernon-Iranian population of Subartu, or Northern Mesopotamia. Like theMitannian kings, the Kassites of Babylonia were a ruling caste oraristocracy, and, though they doubtless brought with them numbers ofhumbler followers, their domination did not affect the linguistic northe racial character of the country in any marked degree. In some ofits aspects we may compare their rule to that of Turkey in the Tigrisand Euphrates valley. They give no evidence of having possessed a highdegree of culture, and though they gradually adopted the civilizationof Babylon, they tended for long to keep themselves aloof, retainingtheir native names along with their separate nationality. They wereessentially a practical people and produced successful administrators.The chief gain they brought to Babylon was an improved method oftime-reckoning. In place of the unwieldy system of date-formulæ,inherited by the Semites from the Sumerians, under which each yearwas known by an elaborate title taken from some great event orcult-observance, the Kassites introduced the simpler plan of dating bythe years of the king's reign. And we shall see that it was directlyowing to the political circumstances of their occupation that the oldsystem of land tenure, already to a great extent undermined by theWestern Semites, was still further modified.But, on the material side, the greatest change they effected in thelife of Babylonia was due to their introduction of the horse. Therecan be little doubt that they were a horse-keeping race,[1] andthe success of their invasion may in large part be traced to theirgreater mobility. Hitherto asses and cattle had been employed for allpurposes of draught and carriage, but, with the appearance of theKassites, the horse suddenly becomes the beast of burden throughoutWestern Asia. Before their time "the ass of the mountain," as it wasdesignated in Babylonia, was a great rarity, the earliest referenceto it occurring in the age of Hammurabi.[2] In that period we haveevidence that Kassite tribes were already forming settlements in thewestern districts of Elam, and when from time to time small partiesof them made their way into the Babylonian plain to be employed asharvesters,[3] they doubtless carried their goods with them in theusual way. The usefulness of horses imported in this manner would haveensured their ready sale to the Babylonians, who probably retained theservices of their owners to tend the strange animals. But the earlyKassite immigrants must have been men of a simple and unprogressivetype, for in all the contract-literature of the period we find no traceof their acquiring wealth, or engaging in the commercial activities oftheir adopted country. The only evidence of their employment in otherthan a menial capacity is supplied by a contract of Ammi-ditana'sreign, which records a two-years' lease of an uncultivated field takenby a Kassite for farming.[4]The Kassite raid into Babylonian territory in Samsu-iluna's reign[5]may have been followed by others of a like character, but it wasonly at the time of the later kings of the Sea-Country that theinvaders succeeded in effecting a permanent foothold in NorthernBabylonia. According to the Kings' List the founder of the ThirdDynasty was Gandash, and we have obtained confirmation of the recordin a Neo-Babylonian tablet purporting to contain a copy of one of hisinscriptions.[6] The Babylonian king, whose text the copy reproduces,there bears the name Gaddash, evidently a contracted form of Gandashas written in the Kings' List; and the record contains an unmistakablereference to the Kassite conquest. From what is left of the inscriptionit may be inferred that it commemorated the restoration of the templeof Bêl, that is, of Marduk, which seems to have been damaged "in theconquest of Babylon." It is clear, therefore, that Babylon must haveoffered a strenuous opposition to the invaders, and that the city heldout until captured by assault. It would seem, too, that this successwas followed up by further conquests of Babylonian territory, for inhis text, in addition to styling himself King of Babylon, Gaddashadopts the other time-honoured titles of King of the four quarters (ofthe world), and King of Sinner and Akkad. We may see evidence in thisthat the kingdom of the Sea-Country was now restricted within itsoriginal limits, though some attempts may have been made to stem thetide of invasion. Ea-gamil, at any rate, the last king of the SecondDynasty, was not content to defend his home-territory, for we know thathe assumed the offensive and invaded Elam. But he appears to have metwith no success, and after his death a Kassite chieftain, Ula-Burariashor Ulam-Buriash, conquered the Sea-Country and established his dominionthere.[7]The late chronicler, who records these events, tells us thatUlam-Buriash was the brother of Kashtiliash, the Kassite, whom wemay probably identify with the third ruler of the Kassite Dynasty ofBabylon. There Gandash, the founder of the dynasty, had been succeededby his son Agum, but after the hitter's reign of twenty-two yearsKashtiliash, a rival Kassite, had secured the throne.[8] He evidentlycame of a powerful Kassite tribe, for it was his brother, Ulam-Buriash,who conquered the Country of the Sea. We have recovered a memorialof the latter's reign in a knob or mace-head of diorite. which wasfound during the excavations at Babylon.[9] On it he terms himselfKing of the Sea-Country, and we learn from it, too, that he and hisbrother were the sons of Burna-Burariash, or Burna-Buriash, who mayhave remained behind as a local Kassite chieftain in Elam, while hissons between them secured the control of Babylonia. After a certaininterval the Sea-Country must have revolted from Ulam-Buriash, forits reconquest was undertaken by Agum, a younger son of Kashtiliash,who is recorded to have captured the city of Dûr-Enlil and to havedestroyed E-malga-uruna, the local temple of Enlil.[10] The eldestson of Kashtiliash had meanwhile succeeded his father on the throne ofBabylon, and, if Agum established his rule in the Sea-Country, we againhave the spectacle of two brothers, in the next generation of thisKassite family, dividing the control of Babylonia between them. But asthe chronicler does not record that Agum, like his uncle Ulam-Buriash,exercised dominion over the Sea-Country as a whole, he may have securedlittle more than a local success. The throne of Babylon then passedto the second son of Kashtiliash, Abi-rattash, and it was possibly byhim, or by one of his successors, that the whole country was once moreunited under Babylon's rule.We know of two more members of the family of Kashtiliash, who carriedon his line at Babylon. For Abi-rattash was succeeded by his son andgrandson, Tashshi-gurumash and Agum-kakrime, of whom the latter hasleft us the record already referred to, commemorating his recoveryof the statues of Marduk and Sarpanitum from the land of Khanî.[11]And then there occurs a great break in our knowledge of the historyof Babylon. For a period extending over some thirteen reigns, fromabout the middle of the seventeenth to the close of the fifteenthcentury B.C., our native evidence is confined to a couple of briefrecords, dating from the latter half of the interval, and to one or twohistorical references in later texts. By their help we have recoveredthe names of a few of the missing kings, though their relative order,and in one or two cases even their existence, are still mattersof controversy. In fact, were we dependent solely upon Babyloniansources, our knowledge of the country's history, even when we canagain establish the succession, would have been practically a blank.But, thanks in great part to the commercial relations establishedwith Syria since the age of the West-Semitic kings, the influence ofBabylonian culture had travelled far afield. Her method of writing onthe convenient and imperishable clay tablet had been adopted by othernations of Western Asia, and her language had become the _linguafranca_ of the ancient world. After her conquest of Canaan, Egypthad become an Asiatic power, and had adopted the current method ofinternational intercourse for communication with other great states andwith her own provinces in Canaan. And thus it has come about that someof our most striking information on the period has come to us, not fromBabylon itself, but from Egypt.The mounds known as Tell el-Amarna in Upper Egypt mark the site ofa city which had a brief but brilliant existence under Amen-hetepIV., or Akhenaten, one of the later kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty.He was the famous "heretic" king, who attempted to suppress theestablished religion of Egypt and to substitute for it a pantheisticmonotheism associated with the worship of the solar disk. In pursuanceof his religious ideas he deserted Thebes, the ancient capital ofthe country, and built a new capital further to the north, which hecalled Akhetaten,[12] the modern Tell el-Amarna. Here he transferredthe official records of his own government and those of his father,Amenhetep III., including the despatches from Egypt's Asiatic provincesand the diplomatic correspondence with kings of Mesopotamia, Assyriaand Babylon. Some twenty-seven years ago a large number of these werediscovered in the ruins of the royal palace, and they form one of themost valuable sources of information on the early relations of Egyptand Western Asia.[13] More recently they have been supplemented by astill larger find of similar documents at Boghaz Keui in Cappadocia,a village built beside the site of Khatti, the ancient capital of theHittite empire. The royal and official archives had been stored forsafety on the ancient citadel, and the few extracts that have as yetbeen published, from the many thousands of documents recovered on thesite, have furnished further information of the greatest value from theHittite standpoint.[14]From these documents we have recovered a very full picture ofinternational politics in Western Asia during two centuries, from theclose of the fifteenth to the later years of the thirteenth centuryB.C. We can trace in some measure the dynastic relations establishedby Egypt with the other great Asiatic states, and the manner in whichthe balance of power was maintained, largely by diplomatic methods.During the earlier part of this period Egyptian power is dominant inPalestine and Syria, while the kingdom of Mitanni, under its Aryandynasty, is a check upon Assyrian expansion. But Egypt was losing herhold upon her Asiatic provinces, and the rise of the Hittite empirecoincided with her decline in power. Mitanni soon fell before theHittites, to the material advantage of Assyria, which began to be amenace to her neighbours upon the west and south. After a change ofdynasty, Egypt had meanwhile in part recovered her lost territory inPalestine, and once more took her place among the great nations ofWestern Asia. And it is only with the fall of the Hittite empire thatthe international situation is completely altered. Throughout Babylonstands, so far as she may, aloof, preoccupied with commerce rather thanwith conquest;[15] but in the latter half of the period her eyes arealways fixed upon her Assyrian frontier.[Illustration: HEAD OF A COLOSSAL STATUE OF AMEN-HETEP III]From the Tell el-Amarna correspondence we see how the kings ofMitanni, Assyria and Babylon gave their daughters to the Egyptianking in marriage and sought to secure his friendship and alliance.Apparently Egypt considered it beneath her dignity to bestow herprincesses in return, for in one of his letters to Amen-hetep III.Kadashman-Enlil remonstrates with the King of Egypt for refusing himone of his daughters and threatens to withhold his own daughter inretaliation.[16] Another of the letters illustrates in a still morestriking manner the intimate international intercourse of the period.At the height of its power the kingdom of Mitanni appears to haveannexed the southern districts of Assyria, and for a time to haveexercised control over Nineveh, as Hammurabi of Babylon had done in anearlier age. It was in his character of suzerain that Dushratta sentthe holy statue of Ishtar of Nineveh to Egypt, as a mark of his esteemfor Amen-hetep III. We have recovered the letter he sent with thegoddess, in which he writes concerning her:[17] " Indeed in the time ofmy father the lady Ishtar went into that land; and, just as she dweltthere formerly and they honoured her, so now may my brother honour herten times more than before. May my brother honour her and may he allowher to return with joy." We thus gather that this was not the firsttime Ishtar had visited Egypt, and we may infer from such a custom thebelief that a deity, when stopping in a foreign country with his or herown consent, would, if properly treated, confer favour and prosperityupon that land. We shall see later on that Rameses II. sent his own godKhonsu on a similar mission to Khatti, in order to cure the epilepticdaughter of the Hittite king, who was believed to be possessed by adevil.[18] We could not have more striking proofs of internationalintercourse. Not only did the rulers of the great states exchange theirdaughters but even their gods.But the letters also exhibit the jealousy which existed between therival states of Asia. By skilful diplomacy, and, particularly inthe reign of Akhenaten, by presents and heavy bribes, the Egyptianking and his advisers succeeded in playing off one power against theother, and in retaining some hold upon their troublesome provinces ofSyria and Palestine. In paying liberal bounties and rewards to hisown followers and party in Egypt itself, Akhenaten was only carryingout the traditional policy of the Egyptian crown;[19] and he extendedthe principle still more in his dealings with foreign states. Butpeculation on the part of the ambassadors was only equalled by thegreed of the monarchs to whom they were accredited, and whose appetitefor Egyptian gold grew with their consumption of it. Much space in theletters is given up to the constant request for more presents, and tocomplaints that promised gifts have not arrived. In one letter, forexample, Ashur-uballit of Assyria writes to Akhenaten that formerly theking of Khanirabbat had received a present of twenty manehs of goldfrom Egypt, and he proceeds to demand a like sum.[20] Burna-Buriashof Babylon, his contemporary, writes in the same strain to Egypt,[21]reminding Akhenaten that Amenophis III. had been far more generous tohis father. "Since the time my father and thine established friendlyrelations with one another, they sent rich presents to one another, andthey did not refuse to one another any desired object. Now my brotherhas sent me as a present two manehs of gold. Send now much gold, asmuch as thy father; and if it is less, send but half that of thyfather. Why hast thou sent only two manehs of gold? For the work in thetemple is great, and I have undertaken it and am carrying it out withvigour; therefore send much gold. And do thou send for whatsoever thoudesirest in my land, that they may take it thee."[Illustration: FIG. 46.AKHENATEN, WITH HIS QUEEN AND INFANT DAUGHTERS, ON THE BALCONY OF THEIRPALACE.The king and his family are hero represented throwing down collarsand ornaments of gold to A , the Priest of Aten and Master of theHorse, who has called at the palace with his wife, attended by a largoretinue. The Aten, or Solar Disk, the object of the royal worship, iscaressing the king with its rays and giving him life.(After N. de G. Davies.)]Though a great part of the royal letters from Tell el-Amarna istaken up with such rather wearisome requests for gold, they alsogive valuable glimpses into the political movements of the time. Wegather, for instance, that Egypt succeeds in preventing Babylon fromgiving support to the revolts in Canaan, but she does not hesitateto encourage Assyria, which is now beginning to display her power asBabylon's rival. Burna-Buriash makes this clear when he complainsthat Akhenaten has received an embassy from the Assyrians, whom heboastfully refers to as his subjects; and he contrasts Babylon's ownreception of Canaanite proposals of alliance against Egypt in the timeof his father Kurigalzu. "In the time of Kurigalzu, my father," hewrites, "the Canaanites sent to him with one accord, saying, 'Let usgo down against the border of the land and invade it, and let us forman alliance with thee.' But my father replied to them, saying, 'Desistfrom seeking to form an alliance with me. If ye are hostile to theking of Egypt, my brother, and ally yourselves with one another, shallI not come and plunder you? For with me is he allied.' My father forthy father's sake did not hearken to them."[22] But Burna-Buriash doesnot trust entirely to the Egyptian's sense of gratitude for Babylon'ssupport in the past. He reinforces his argument by a present of threemanehs of lapis-lazuli, five yoke of horses and five wooden chariots.Lapis-lazuli and horses were the two most valuable exports from Babylonduring the Kassite period, and they counterbalanced to some extentEgypt's almost inexhaustible supply of Nubian gold.Babylon at this time had no territorial ambitions outside the limit ofher own frontiers. She was never menaced by Mitanni, and it was onlyafter the fall of the latter kingdom that she began to be uneasy at theincrease of Assyrian power.[23] Apart from the defence of her frontier,her chief preoccupation was to keep the trade-routes open, especiallythe Euphrates route to Syria and the north. Thus we find Burna-Buriashremonstrating with Egypt when the caravans of one of his messengers,named Salmu, had been plundered by two Canaanite chiefs, and demandingcompensation.[24] On another occasion he writes that Babylonianmerchants had been robbed and slain at Khinnatuni in Canaan,[25] andhe again holds Akhenaten responsible. "Canaan is thy land," he says,"and its kings are thy servants;" and he demands that the losses shouldbe made good and the murderers slain.[26] But Egypt was at this periodso busy with her own affairs that she had not the time, nor even thepower, to protect the commercial interests of her neighbours. For inthe majority of the Tell el-Amarna letters we see her Asiatic empirefalling to pieces.[27] From Northern Syria to Southern Palestine theEgyptian governors and vassal rulers vainly attempt to quell rebellionand to hold back invading tribes.The source of a good deal of the trouble was the great Hittite power,away to the north in the mountains of Anatolia. The Hittite kingshad formed a confederation of their own peoples north of the Taurus,and they were now pressing southwards into Phœnicia and the Lebanon.They coveted the fertile plains of Northern Syria, and Egypt was thepower that blocked their path. They were not at first strong enough tochallenge Egypt by direct invasion of her provinces, so they confinedthemselves to stirring up rebellion among the native princes ofCanaan. These they encouraged to throw off the Egyptian yoke, and toattack those cities which refused to join them. The loyal chiefs andgovernors appealed for help to Egypt, and their letters show that theygenerally appealed in vain. For Akhenaten was a weak monarch, and wasfar more interested in his heretic worship of the Solar Disk than inretaining the foreign empire he had inherited. It was in his reign thatthe Anatolian Hittites began to take an active part in the politics ofWestern Asia.[Illustration: FIGS. 47 AND 48. REPRESENTATIONS OF HITTITES IN EGYPTIANSCULPTURE.The two Figures are parts of the same scene from a relief found atKarnak, representing the introduction of Asiatic ambassadors by anEgyptian prince to Rameses II. The bearded Semites are readily to bedistinguished from their Hittite colleagues, clean-shaven and withtheir long plaits of hair, or pig-tails, hanging down the back.(After Meyer.)]Until the discovery of the documents at Boghaz Keui, it had only beenpossible to deduce the existence of the Hittites from the mark they hadleft in the records of Egypt and Assyria; and at that time it was noteven certain whether we might regard as their work the hieroglyphicrock-inscriptions, which are scattered over a great part of Asia Minor.But it is now possible to supplement our material from native sources,and to trace the gradual extension of their power by both conquest anddiplomacy. They were a virile race, and their strongly marked featuresmay be still seen, not only on their own rock-sculptures, but alsoin Egyptian reliefs beside those of other Asiatics.[28] In facialtype, too, they are quite distinct, for the nose, though prominent andslightly curved, is not very fleshy, mouth and chin are small, and theforehead recedes abruptly, with the hair drawn back from it and fallingin one, or possibly in two plaits, or pig-tails, on the shoulders.[29]It is still not certain to which of the great families of nations theybelonged. The suggestion has been made that their language has certainIndo-European characteristics, but for the present it is safer toregard them as an indigenous race of Asia Minor.[30] Their facial typein any case suggests comparison as little with Aryan as with Semiticstock.[Illustration: FIG. 49. HITTITE FOOT-SOLDIERS AT THE BATTLE OF KADESH.The figure illustrates the facial type of the Hittite, with hisprominent and slightly curved nose and strongly receding brow.(After Meyer.)]Their civilization was strongly influenced by that of Babylonia,perhaps through the medium of Assyrian trading settlements, which werealready established in Cappadocia in the second half of the thirdmillennium. From these early Semitic immigrants, or their successors,they borrowed the clay tablet and the cuneiform system of writing.But they continued to use their own picture-characters for monumentalrecords; and even in the later period, when they came into directcontact with the Assyrian empire, their art never lost its individualcharacter. Some of the most elaborate of their rock-sculptures stillsurvive in the holy sanctuary at Yasili Kaya, not far from Boghaz Keui.Here on the rock-face, in a natural fissure of the mountain, are carvedthe figures of their deities, chief among them the great Mother-goddessof the Hittites.[Illustration: FIG. 50.HITTITE CHIEFTAIN, A CAPTIVE OF RAMESES III.A relief of the twelfth century, perhaps the finest representationof a Hittite on the Egyptian monuments; it is evidently a portraitsculpture, so far as the head is concerned. It illustrates, too, themanner in which the heavy plait of hair ends in a curled tail.(After Meyer.)]She and Teshub, the principal male deity, are here represented meeting,with their processions of deities and attendants. Whether it wasfrom precisely this area that the Hittite tribes descended on theirraid down the Euphrates, which hastened the fall of Babylon's FirstDynasty and perhaps brought it to an end, we have as yet no means ofjudging.[31] But during the subsequent centuries we may certainlypicture a slow but uninterrupted expansion of the area under Hittitecontrol; and it is probable that authority was divided among thevarious local kingdoms and chieftainships, which occupied the valleysand upland stretches to the north of the Taurus.[Illustration: FIG. 51.FIGURE, PROBABLY OF A HITTITE KING, FROM THE ROYAL GATE AT KHATTI.The pose of the figure, slightly leaning to the right, is due to thesloping side of the gateway, beside which it is sculptured in relief.(After a photo by Puchstein.]At the time of their empire, their capital and central fortress wasKhatti, which lay to the east of the Halys, on the Anatolian plateausome three thousand feet above sea-level. It occupied a strong positionnear the crossing of the great lines of traffic through Asia Minor;and expansion from this area must have begun to take place at anearly period beyond the west bank of the river, where the countryoffered greater facilities for pasturage. Another line of advance wassouthward to the coast-plains beneath the Taurus, and it is certainthat Cilicia was occupied by Hittite tribes before any attempt was madeon Northern Syria. That at first the Hittites were scattered, withoutany central organization, among a number of independent city-states,may be inferred from their later records. For when a land is referredto in their official documents, it is designated "the country of thecity of so and so," suggesting that each important township had beenthe centre of an independent district to which it gave its name. Someof the Hittite states attained in time to a considerable degree ofimportance. Thus we find Tarkundaraba of Arzawa sufficiently eminentto marry a daughter of Amen-hetep III. of Egypt.[32] Another citywas Kussar, one of whose kings, Khattusil I., was the father ofShubbiluliuma, under whom the Hittites were organized into a strongconfederacy which endured for nearly two hundred years. It must havebeen owing to its strategic importance that Shubbiluliuma selectedKhatti as his capital in place of his ancestral city.Quite apart from its name, and from the traditions attaching to it,there can be no question but that from this time forward Khatti wasthe centre of Hittite power and civilization; for it is by far themost extensive Hittite site in existence. It covers the high ground,including the hill-top, above Boghaz Keui, which lies in the valleybelow; and it is fortunate that the greater part of the modern villagewas built clear of the outer boundaries of the ancient city, as theruins have in consequence run far less risk of destruction.[33] It wasplaced high for purely strategic purposes, commanding as it does theRoyal Road from the west and the great trunk-road from the south asthey approach the city-walls. The citadel was formed by a flat-toppedhill,[34] which dominates the walled city to the north, west, andsouth of it. Its precipitous slopes descend on the north-east sideto a mountain stream outside the walls; and a similar stream, fed byshallow gullies, flows north-westward through the city-area. From thepoint where they rise in the south, to their junction below the city,the ground falls no less than a thousand feet, and the uneven surfacehas been fully utilized for its defence. The wall which surroundedthe southern and higher half of the city is still comparatively wellpreserved, and forms three sides of a rough hexagon, but the fallingand broken ground to the north prevented a symmetrical completion ofthe circuit. A series of interior fortification-walls, following theslope of the ground, enclosed a number of irregular areas, subsidiaryforts being constructed on four smaller hills along the most southerlycross-wall, which shut in the highest part of the city.[Illustration: FIG. 52.THE ROYAL GATE OF KHATTI, THE CAPITAL OF THE HITTITES, VIEWED FROM THEOUTSIDE.The massive walls are preserved in their lower courses, but in thesketch the upper portions are restored in outline. The arched gatewaywith its sloping sides is characteristic of Hittite work.(After Puchstein.)]The city's greatest length from north to south was about a mile and aquarter, and its greatest width some three-quarters of a mile, thewhole circuit of the existing defences, including the lower-lying area,extending to some three and a half miles. This is a remarkable size fora mountain city, and although some portions of the area cannot havebeen occupied by buildings, the fortification of so extensive a site isan indication of the power of the Hittite empire and its capital. Aboutfourteen feet in thickness, the wall is preserved in many places to ahight of more than twelve feet. It consists of an inner and an outerwall, filled in with a stone packing. The outer face was naturally thestronger of the two, and huge stones, sometimes five feet in length,have been employed in its construction. The wall was strengthenedby towers, set at more or less regular intervals along it, theirposition being sometimes dictated by the contour of the ground. Rounda great part of the circuit there are traces of an outer defensivewall of lighter construction and with smaller towers, but this was notcontinuous, being omitted wherever the natural fall of the ground was asufficient protection to the main wall.[Illustration: FIG. 53.CONJECTURAL RESTORATION OF A HITTITE GATEWAY VIEWED FROM INSIDE.It is possible that brick was employed for the upper structure of thecity-wall and its towers, as suggested in the restoration. In such acase it is not unlikely that the stepped battlements of Mesopotamiawere also adopted.(After Puchstein.)]Projecting towers also flanked the main gateways, which exhibit acharacteristic feature of Hittite architecture. This is the peculiarform of the gateway, consisting of a pointed arch with gently slopingsides, the latter formed by huge monoliths bonded into the structure ofthe wall.[35] It would seem that brick was probably employed for theupper structure of both wall and towers; and in other buildings of thecity, such as the great temple to the north-west of the citadel, brickwas used for the upper structure of the walls upon a stone foundation.Whenever the use of brick was adopted in one of the northern lands ofMesopotamia, where stone is plentiful, the latter was always used inthe foundations. It is not improbable, therefore, that the steppedbattlements of Assyria and Babylon were also borrowed, as that was themost convenient and decorative way of finishing off the upper coursesof a fortification-wall built of that material.In the earlier years of Shubbiluliuma the city was doubtless verymuch smaller than it subsequently became. But he used it effectivelyas a base, and, as much by diplomatic means as by actual conquest,he succeeded in making the power of the Hittites felt beyond theirown borders. The Syrian revolts in the reign of Amen-hetep III., bywhich the authority of Egypt was weakened in her Asiatic provinces,undoubtedly received Hittite encouragement. Shubbiluliuma also crossedthe Euphrates and ravaged the northern territory of Mitanni, theprincipal rival of the Hittites up to that time. Later he invadedSyria in force and returned to his mountain fastness of Khatti, ladenwith spoil and leading two Mitannian princes as captives in his train.On the accession of Akhenaten, Shubbiluliuma wrote him a letter ofcongratulation; but, when the Syrian prince Aziru acknowledged thesuzerainty of Egypt, Shubbiluliuma defeated him and laid the whole ofNorthern Syria under tribute, subsequently confirming his possession ofthe country by treaty with Egypt. The state of Mitanni, too, submittedto Shubbiluliuma's dictation, for, on the murder of its powerful kingDushratta, he espoused the cause of Mattiuaza, whom he restored to hisfather's throne after marrying him to his daughter. We have recoveredthe text of his treaty with Mitanni, and it reflects the despotic powerof the Hittite king at this time. Referring to himself in the thirdperson he says, "The great king, for the sake of his daughter, gave thecountry of Mitanni a new life."[36][Illustration: FIG. 54.LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF THE LOWER WESTERN GATEWAY AT KHATTI.The diagram, based on the conjectural restoration, indicates themassive construction of the gate-house, and the manner in which both itand the wall were adapted to the rising ground. The passage-way alongthe battlements must have passed through the towers.(After Puchstein.)]It was not until the reign of Mursil, a younger son of Shubbiluliuma,that the Hittite empire came into armed conflict with Egypt. A changeof dynasty in the latter country, and the restoration of her oldreligion, had strengthened the government, and now led to renewedattempts on her part at recovering her lost territory. On the firstoccasion the Hittites were defeated by Seti I. in the north of Syria,and Egypt reoccupied Phoenicia and Canaan. Later on, probably in thereign of Mutallu, Mursil's son, Rameses II. attempted to recoverNorthern Syria. At the battle of Kadesh, on the Orontes, he succeededin defeating the Hittite army, though both sides lost heavily and atan early stage of the fight Rameses himself was in imminent danger ofcapture. Episodes in the battle may still be seen pictured in relief onthe temple-walls at Luxor, Karnak and Abydos.[37][Illustration: FIG. 55.TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE LOWER WESTERN GATEWAY AT KHATTI. The exteriorprojection of each flanking tower beyond the wall is indicated in thediagram. (After Puchstein.)]The Egyptian war was continued with varying success, though it iscertain that the Hittites were eventually successful in the north.But in the reign of Khattusil, the brother of Mutallu, both sides wereweary of the conflict, and an elaborate treaty of peace and alliancewas drawn up. This, when engraved upon a silver tablet, was carriedto Egypt by an ambassador and presented to Rameses. The contents ofthe treaty have long been known from the Egyptian text, engraved onthe walls of the temple at Karnak; and among the tablets found atBoghaz Keui was a broken copy of the original Hittite version,[38]drawn up in cuneiform characters and in Babylonian, the language ofdiplomacy at the period. Khattusil also maintained friendly relationswith the Babylonian court, and he informed the king of Babylon of histreaty with the king of Egypt. It is clear from a copy of the letter,recovered at Boghaz Keui, that the Babylonian king had heard about thetreaty and had written to enquire concerning it. Khattusil replies thatthe king of Egypt and he had formed a friendship and had concluded analliance: "We are brothers, and against a foe will we fight together,and with a friend will we together maintain friendship."[39] And hisnext remark enables us to identify his Kassite correspondent; forhe adds, "and when the king of Egypt [formerly] attacked [Khatti],then did I write to inform thy father Kadashman-turgu." Khattusilwas thus the contemporary of two Kassite kings, Kadashman-turgu andKadashman-Enlil II., the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth rulers of thedynasty.Another section of this letter is of considerable interest, as it showsthat an attempt by Khattusil to intervene in Babylonian politics hadbeen resented, and had led to a temporary estrangement between the twocountries. Khattusil is at pains to reassure Kadashman-Enlil as to theunselfishness of his motives, explaining that the action he had takenhad been dictated entirely by the Kassite king's own interests. Theepisode had occurred on the death of Kadashman-turgu, and, accordingto Khattusil's account, he had at once written to Babylon to say that,unless the succession of Kadashman-Enlil, who was then a boy, wasrecognized, he would break off the alliance he had concluded with thelate king, Kadasman-Enlil's father. The Babylonian chief minister,Itti-Marduk-balâtu, had taken offence at the tone of the letter, andhad replied that the Hittite king had not written in the tone ofbrotherhood, but had issued his commands as though the Babylonians werehis vassals. As a result, diplomatic negotiations had been broken offduring the young king's minority; but he had now attained his majority,and had taken the direction of affairs from his minister's hands intohis own. The long communication from Khattusil must have been writtenshortly after the resumption of diplomatic intercourse.After giving these explanations of his present relations with Egypt,and of his former discontinuance of negotiations with Babylon,Khattusil passes on to matters which doubtless had furnished theoccasion for his letter. Certain Babylonian merchants, when journeyingby caravan to Amurru and Ugarit, a town in Northern Phœnicia, had beenmurdered; and, as the responsibility lay on the Hittite empire in itscharacter of suzerain, Kudashman-Enlil had apparently addressed toKhattusil the demand that the guilty parties should be handed over tothe relatives of the murdered men. The reference is of interest, as itgives further proof of Babylon's commercial activities in the West,and shows how, after Egypt had lost her control of Northern Syria,the Kassite rulers addressed themselves to its new suzerain to secureprotection for their caravans.We have evidence that such diplomatic action was thoroughly effective,for not only had Babylon's language and system of writing penetratedWestern Asia, but her respect for law and her legislative methodshad accompanied them, at any rate within the Hittite area. The pointis well illustrated by one of the last sections in this remarkableletter, which deals with a complaint by the Babylonian king concerningsome action of the Amorite prince, Banti-shinni. The Amorite, whenaccused by Khattusil of having "troubled the land" of Kadashman-Enlil,had replied by advancing a counterclaim for thirty talents of silveragainst the inhabitants of Akkad. After stating this fact, Khattusilcontinues in his letter: "Now, since Banti-Shinni has become my vassal,let my brother prosecute the claim against him; and, concerning thetroubling of my brother's land, he shall make his defence before thegod[40] in the presence of thy ambassador, Adad-shar-ilâni. And if mybrother will not conduct the action (himself), then shall thy servantcome who has heard that Banti-Shinni harassed my brother's land, and heshall conduct the action. Then will I summon Banti-Shinni to answer thecharge. He is (my) vassal. If he harasses my brother, does he not thenharass me?"[41][Illustration: FIG. 56.ONE OF THE TWO SACRED BOATS OF KHONSU, THE EGYPTIAN MOON-GOD, WHOJOURNEYED INTO CAPPADOCIA TO CAST OUT A DEVIL FROM A HITTITE PRINCESS.A priest is offering incense before the shrine and sacred boat, whichis being carried on the shoulders of other priests. In the accompanyinginscription on the original stele, the god is referred to in hischaracter as "Plan-Maker in Thebes" and "Smiter of Evil Spirits."(After Rosellini.)]It may be that Hittite diplomacy is here making use of the Babylonianrespect for law, to find a way out of a difficult situation; but themere proposal of such a trial as that suggested proves that the usualmethod of settling international disputes of a minor character wasmodelled on Babylon's internal legislative system. It is clear that theHittite was anxious to prevent strained relations with Babylon, for hegoes on to urge Kadashman-Enlil to attack a common enemy, whom he doesnot name. This must have been Assyria, whose growing power had become amenace to both states, and had caused them to draw together for mutualsupport.[Illustration: FIG. 57.RAMESES II. OFFERING INCENSE TO ONE OF THE BOATS OF KHONSU BEFORE HESTARTED ON HIS JOURNEY.The sacred boat of Khonsu is here being borne by a larger retinue ofpriests into the presence of the king, who did not accompany the god onhis journey.(After Rosellini.)]The account that has been given of this lengthy document will haveindicated the character of the royal correspondence discovered atBoghaz Keui. In some respects it closely resembles that from Tellel-Amarna, but it exhibits a pleasing contrast by the complete absenceof those whining petitions for gold and presents, which bulk so largelyin the earlier documents. The Egyptian policy of doles and bribery hadbrought out the worst side of the Oriental character. The Hittite didnot believe in doles, and in any case he had not them to give; as aconsequence, his correspondence confines itself in great measure tomatters of state and high policy, and exhibits far greater dignityand self-respect. And this applies equally, so far as we can see, tothe communications with Egypt, who had recovered from her temporarydecadence. There can be little doubt that the royal Hittite letters,when published, will enable us to follow the political movements of theperiod in even greater detail.One other act of Khattusil may be referred to, as it illustrates in thereligious sphere the breaking down of international barriers which tookplace. A few years after the completion of his great treaty, Khattusilbrought his daughter to Egypt, where she was married to Rameses withgreat pomp and circumstance. An intimate friendship continued to existbetween the two royal families, and when Bentresh, his sister-in-law,fell ill in Khatti and was believed to be incurably possessed by adevil, Rameses hastened to send his physician to cure her.[42] But hisefforts proving fruitless, the Pharaoh despatched the holy image ofKhonsu, the Egyptian Moon-god, to Cappadocia, in order to cure her. Thegod duly arrived at the distant capital, and, while he wrought with theevil spirit, it is said that the Hittite king "stood with his soldiersand feared very greatly."[43] But Khonsu was victorious, and thespirit having departed in peace to the place whence he came, there wasgreat rejoicing. The episode forms an interesting parallel to Ishtar'sjourney into Egypt in the reign of Amenhetep III.There is no doubt that the son and grandson of Khattusil, Dudkhaliaand Arnuanta, carried on their father's policy of friendliness towardsBabylon, who had no reason politically to resent the intrusion ofEgyptian influence at Khatti.[44] But Arnuanta is the last kingof Khatti whose name has been recovered, and it is certain that inthe following century the invasion of Anatolia by the Phrygians andthe Muski put an end to Hittite power in Cappadocia. The Hittiteswere pressed southward through the passes, and they continued towield a diminished political influence in Northern Syria. MeanwhileAssyria profited by their downfall and disappearance in the north.She had already expanded at the expense of Mitanni, and now that thissecond check upon her was removed, the balance of power ceased to bemaintained in Western Asia. Babylon's history from this time forwardis in great part moulded by her relations with the northern kingdom.Even at the time of the later Hittite kings she failed to maintain herfrontier from Assyrian encroachment, and the capital itself was soon tofall. We are able to follow the course of these events in some detail,as, with the reign of Kara-indash I., the earliest of Amen-hetep III.'scorrespondents,[45] our sources of information are increased by theso-called "Synchronistic History" of Assyria and Babylonia,[46] whichfurnishes a series of brief notices concerning the relations maintainedbetween the two countries.[Illustration: HITTITE HIËROGLYPHIC INSCRIPTION After Hogarth,Carchemish, pl. B, 6.]In the long period between Agum-kakrime[47] and Kara-indash, the namesof three Kassite rulers only have recovered. From a kudurru,[48] orlegal document, of the reign of Kadashman-Enlil I. we learn of twoearlier Kassite kings, Kadashman-Kharbe and his son Kurigalzu,[49]and it is possible that a son of the latter, Meli-Shipak, succeededhis father on the throne.[50] We know nothing of Babylon's relationsto Assyria at this time, and our first glimpse of their long strugglefor supremacy is in the reign of Kara-indash, who is recorded to havemade a friendly agreement with Ashur-rim-nishêshu with regard totheir common boundary.[51] That such an agreement should have beendrawn up is in itself evidence of friction, and it is not surprisingthat a generation or so later Burna-Buriash, the correspondent ofAmen-hetep III., should have found it necessary to conclude a similartreaty with Puzur-Ashur, the contemporary Assyrian king.[52] We mayregard these agreements as marking the beginning of the first phase inBabylon's subsequent dealings with Assyria, which closes with friendlyagreements of a like character at the time of the Fourth Babyloniandynasty. During the intervening period of some three centuries friendlyrelations were constantly interrupted by armed conflicts, whichgenerally resulted in a rectification of the frontier to Babylon'sdisadvantage. On only one occasion was she victorious in battle, andtwice during the period the capital itself was taken. But Assyria wasnot yet strong enough to dominate the southern kingdom for any lengthof time, and at the close of the period Babylon may still be regardedas in occupation of a great part of her former territory, but withsorely diminished prestige.To appreciate the motives which impelled Assyria from time to timeto intervene in Babylonian politics, and to attempt spasmodicallya southward expansion, it would be necessary to trace out her ownhistory, and note the manner in which her ambition in other quartersreacted upon her policy in the south. As that would be out of placein the present volume, it will suffice here to summarize events sofar as Babylon was affected. The friendly attitude of Puzur-Ashurto Burna-Buriash was maintained by the more powerful Assyrian kingAshur-uballit, who cemented an alliance between the two countriesby giving Burna-Buriash his daughter Muballitat-Sherûa in marriage.On the death of Burna-Buriash, his son Kara-indash II., who wasAshur-uballit's grandson, ascended the throne, and it was probablydue to his Assyrian sympathies that the Kassite party in Babylonrevolted, slew him and set Nazi-bugash in his place. Ashur-uballitinvaded Babylonia, and having taken vengeance on Nazi-bugash, putKurigalzu III., another son of Burna-Buriash, upon the throne.[53] Butthe young Kurigalzu did not fulfil the expectations of his Assyrianrelatives, for after Ashur-uballit's death he took the initiativeagainst Assyria,[54] and was defeated at Sugagi on the Zabzallat byEnlil-nirari, to whom he was obliged to cede territory. A furtherextension of Assyrian territory was secured by Adad-nirari I., when hedefeated Kurigalzu's son and successor, Nazi-maruttash, at Kâr-Ishtarin the frontier district of Akarsallu.[55] We have already seen fromthe Boghaz Keui correspondence how the Hittite Empire and Babylon weredrawn together at this time by dread of their common foe, doubtlessin consequence of the aggressive policy of Shalmaneser I. We do notknow whether Kadashman-Enlil II. followed the promptings of Khattusil,and it is not until the reign of Kashtiliash II.[56] that we haverecord of fresh conflicts. Then it was that Babylon suffered her firstserious disaster at Assyrian hands. Up to this time we have seen thattwo Assyrian kings had defeated Babylonian armies, and had exactedcessions of territory as the result of their victories. Tukulti-NinibI. was only following in their steps when he in turn defeatedKashtiliash. But his achievement differed from theirs in degree, forhe succeeded in capturing Babylon itself, deported the Babylonianking, and, instead of merely acquiring a fresh strip of territory, hesubdued Karduniash[57] and administered it as a province of his kingdomtill his death.[58] The revolts which closed Tukulti-Ninib's reignand life[59] were soon followed by Babylon's only successful campaignagainst Assyria.Adad-shum-usur, who owed his throne to a revolt of the Kassitenobles against the Assyrian domination, restored the fortunes of hiscountry for a time. He defeated and slew Enlil-kudur-usur in battle,and, when the Assyrians retreated, he followed them up and foughta battle before Ashur. This successful reassertion of Babylon'sinitiative was maintained by his direct descendants Meli-Shipak II. andMarduk-aplu-iddina, or Merodach-baladan I.; and the kudurru-records oftheir reigns, which have been recovered, have thrown an interestinglight on the internal conditions of the country during the laterKassite period. But Assyria once again asserted herself under Ashur-dânI., who defeated Zamama-shum-iddin and succeeded in recovering herlost frontier provinces.[60] The Kassite dynasty did not long survivethis defeat, although it received its death-blow from another quarter.Shutruk-Nakhkhunte, the Elamite king, invaded Babylonia, defeatedand slew Zamama-shum-iddin, and, aided by son Kutir-Nakhkhunte, hesacked Sippar and carried away much spoil to Elam. The name of thelast Kassite ruler, who reigned for only three years, is brokenin the Kings' List, but it is possible that we may restore it asBêlnadin-akhi,[61] whom Nebuchadnezzar I. mentions after referring tothe invasion which cost Zamama-shum-iddin his life. Whether we acceptthe identification or not, we may certainly connect the fall of theKassite Dynasty with aggression on the part of Elam, such as so oftenbefore had changed the course of Babylonian politics.Apart from the tablets of the Kassite period discovered at Nippur,[62]our principal source of information on economic conditions inBabylonia at this time is to be found in the kudurru-inscriptions, orboundary-stones, to which reference has already been made.[63] Theword _kudurru_ may be rendered accurately enough as "boundary-stone,"for the texts are engraved on conical blocks or boulders of stone; andthere is little doubt that many of the earlier stones must have beenset up on landed estates, whose limits and ownership they were intendedto define and commemorate. Even at a time when the stone itself hadceased to be employed to mark the boundary and was preserved in theowner's house, or in the temple of his god, as a charter or title-deedto which he could appeal in case of need, the text preserved its oldformulas setting out the limits and orientation of the plot of land towhich it referred. The importance of these records is considerable,not only in their legal and religious aspects, but also from ahistorical point of view. Apart from the references to Babyloniankings and to historical events, which they contain, they form in manycases the only documents of their period which have come down to us.They thus serve to bridge the gap in our knowledge of Euphrateancivilization between the Kassite epoch and that of the Neo-Babyloniankings; and, while they illustrate the development which graduallytook place in Babylonian law and custom, they prove the continuity ofculture during times of great political change.[64]The kudurru or boundary-stone had its origin under the Kassite kings,and, while at first recording, or confirming, a royal grant of land toan important official or servant of the king, its aim was undoubtedlyto place the newly acquired rights of the owner under the protection ofthe gods. A series of curses, regularly appended to the legal record,was directed against any interference with the owner's rights, whichwere also placed under the protection of a number of deities whosesymbols were engraved upon the blank spaces of the stone. It has beensuggested that the idea of placing property under divine protectionwas not entirely an innovation of the Kassites. It is true that thefoundation-cones of the early Sumerian patesi Entemena may well haveended with elaborate curses intended to preserve a frontier-ditch fromviolation.[65] But the cones themselves, and the stele from which theywere copied, were intended to protect a national frontier, not theboundaries of private property. Gate-sockets, too, have been treated asclosely related to boundary-stones, on the ground that the thresholdof a temple might be regarded as its boundary.[66] But the main objectof the gate-socket was to support the temple-gate, and its prominentposition and the durable nature of its material no doubt suggested itsemployment as a suitable place for a commemorative inscription. Thepeculiarity of the boundary-stone is that, by both curse and sculpturedemblem, it invokes divine protection upon private property and therights of private individuals.In the age of Hammurabi we have no evidence of such a practice, andthe Obelisk of Manishtusu,[67] the far earlier Semitic king of Akkad,which records his extensive purchases of land in Northern Babylonia, iswithout the protection of imprecatory clauses or symbols of the gods.The suggestion is thus extremely probable that the custom of protectingprivate property in this way arose at a time when the authority of thelaw was not sufficiently powerful to guarantee respect for the propertyof private individuals.[68] This would specially apply to grantsof land to favoured officials settled among a hostile population,especially if no adequate payment for the property had been made by theKassite king. The disorder and confusion which followed the fall of theFirst Dynasty must have been renewed during the Kassite conquest ofthe country, and the absence of any feeling of public security wouldaccount for the general adoption of such a practice as placing land inprivate possession under the protection of the gods.The use of stone stelæ for this purpose may well have been suggested bya Kassite custom; for in the mountains of Western Persia, the recenthome of the Kassite tribes before their conquest of the river-plain,stones had probably been used to mark the limits of their fields, andthese may well have borne short inscriptions giving the owner's nameand title.[69] The employment of curses to secure divine protectionwas undoubtedly of Babylonian, and ultimately of Sumerian origin, butthe idea of placing symbols of the gods upon the stone was probablyKassite.[70] Moreover, the kudurru was not the original title-deedrecording the acquisition of the land to which it refers. As in theearlier Babylonian periods, clay tablets continued to be employed forthis purpose, and they received the impression of the royal seal asevidence of the king's sanction and authority. The text of the tablet,generally with the list of witnesses, was later on recopied by theengraver upon the stone, and the curses and symbols were added.[71]A boundary-stone was sometimes employed to commemorate a confirmationof title, and, like many modern legal documents, it recited theprevious history of the property during a long period extending overseveral reigns. But the majority of the stones recovered commemorateoriginal grants of land made by the king to a relative, or to one ofhis adherents in return for some special service. Perhaps the finest ofthis class of charters is that in which Meli-Shipak makes a grant ofcertain property in Bît-Pir-Shadû-rabû, near the old city of Akkad orAgade and the Kassite town Dûr-Kurigalzu, to his son Merodach-baladanI., who afterwards succeeded him upon the throne.[72] After giving thesize and situation of the estates, and the names of the high officialswho had been entrusted with the duty of drawing up the survey, the textdefines the privileges granted to Merodach-baladan along with the land.As some of these throw considerable light on the system of land tenureduring the Kassite period, they may be briefly summarized.[KASSITE BOUNDARY STONES SET UP IN THE REIGNS OF MELI-SHIPAK ANDNAZI-MARUTTASH. After Délég. en Perse, Mém. I, pl. XVI et XIV]The king, in conferring the ownership of the land upon his son,freed it from all taxes and tithes, and forbade the displacement ofits ditches, limits, and boundaries. He freed it also from the_corvée,_ and enacted that none of the people of the estate were to berequisitioned among the gangs levied in its district for public works,for the prevention of flood, or for the repair of the royal canal, asection of which was maintained in working order by the neighbouringvillages of Bît-Sikkamidu and Damiḳ-Adad. They were not liable toforced labour on the canal-sluices, nor for building dams, nor fordigging out the canal-bed. No cultivator on the property, whetherhired or belonging to the estate, was to be requisitioned by the localgovernor even under royal authority. No levy was to be made on wood,grass, straw, corn, or any sort of crop, on the carts and yokes, onasses or man-servants. No one was to use his son's irrigation-ditch,and no levy was to be made on his water-supply even during times ofdrought. No one was to mow his grass-land without his permission, andno beasts belonging to the king or governor, which might be assigned tothe district, were to be driven over or pastured on the estate. And,finally, he was freed from all liability to build a road or a bridgefor the public convenience, even though the king or the governor shouldgive the order.From these regulations it will be seen that the owner of land inBabylonia under the later Kassite kings, unless granted specialexemption, was liable to furnish forced labour for public works bothto the state and to his local district; he had to supply grazing andpasture for the flocks and herds of the king and the governor, and topay various taxes and tithes on land, irrigation-water, and crops. Wehave already noted the prevalence of similar customs under the FirstDynasty,[73] and it is clear that the successive conquests to whichthe country had been subjected, and its domination by a foreign race,had not to any appreciable extent affected the life and customs of thepeople nor even the general character of the administrative system.On one subject the boundary-stones throw additional light, whichis lacking at the period of the First Dynasty, and that is the oldBabylonian system of land tenure. They suggest that the lands, whichformed the subject of royal grants during the Kassite period, weregenerally the property of the local _bîtu,_ or tribe.[74] In certaincases the king actually purchased the land from the _bîtu_ in whosedistrict it was situated, and, when no consideration was given, weneed merely assume that it was requisitioned by royal authority. Theprimitive system of tribal or collective proprietorship, which isattested by the Obelisk of Manishtusu,[75] undoubtedly survived intothe Kassite period, when it co-existed with the system of privateownership, as it had doubtless done at the time of the West-Semitickings. The _bîtu_ must often have occupied an extensive area, split upinto separate districts or groups of villages. It had its own head, the_bêl bîti,_ and its own body of local functionaries, who were quitedistinct from the official and military servants of the state. Infact, agricultural life in Babylonia during the earlier periods musthave presented many points of analogy to such examples of collectiveproprietorship as may be seen in the village communities of Indiaat the present day. As the latter system has survived the politicalchanges and revolutions of many centuries, so it is probable that thetribal proprietorship in Babylonia was slow to decay.The principal factor in its disintegration was undoubtedly the policy,pursued by the West-Semitic and Kassite conquerors, of settling theirown officers and more powerful adherents on estates throughout thecountry. Both these periods thus represent a time of transition, duringwhich the older system of land tenure gradually gave way in face of thepolicy of private ownership, which for purely political reasons was sostrongly encouraged by the crown. There can be no doubt that under theWest-Semitic kings, at any rate from the time of Hammurabi onwards, thepolicy of confiscation was rarely resorted to. And even the earlierrulers of that dynasty, since they were of the same racial stock asa large proportion of their new subjects, would have been the moreinclined to respect tribal institutions which may have found a parallelin their land of origin. The Kassites, on the other hand, had no suchracial associations to restrain them, and it is significant that thekudurrus were now for the first time introduced, with their threateningemblems of divinity and their imprecatory clauses. At first employedto guard the rights of private ownership, often based on high-handedrequisition by the king, they were afterwards retained for transfersof landed property by purchase. In the Neo-Babylonian period, when theboundary-stones recorded long series of purchases by means of which thelarger landed estates were built up, the imprecations and symbols hadbecome to a great extent conventional survivals.But that period was still far distant, and the vicissitudes the countrywas to pass through were not conducive to security of tenure, whetherthe property were held under private or collective ownership. We haveseen that Assyria, as early as the thirteenth century, had succeededin capturing and sacking Babylon, and, according to one tradition, hadruled the city for seven years. She was shortly to renew her attemptsto subjugate the southern kingdom; but it was Elam, Babylon's stillolder foe, that brought the long and undistinguished Kassite Dynasty toan end.[Footnote 1: Proof that the Aryans were horse-keepers may be seenin the numerous Iranian proper names which include _asva_ (_aspa_),"horse," as a component; see Justi, "Iran. Namenbuch," p. 486, and cf.Meyer, "Geschichte," I., ii., p. 579.][Footnote 2: It is on a text of that period that we find the firstmention of the horse in antiquity; cf. Ungnad, "Orient. Lit.-Zeit.,"1907, col. 638 f., and King, "Journ. of Hellenic Studies," XXXIII., p.359. A reference to one also occurs in a letter of the early Babylonianperiod (cf. "Cun. Texts in the Brit. Mus.," IV., pl. 1), but, tojudge from the writing, this is probably rather later than the timeof Hammurabi. It is immediately after the Kassite period that we haveevidence of the adoption of the horse as a divine symbol, doubtlessthat of a deity introduced by the Kassites; see Plate XXII., oppositep. 254.][Footnote 3: Some First Dynasty tablets record the issue of rations tocertain Kassites, who were obviously employed as labourers, probablyfor getting in the harvest (cf. Ungnad, "Beitr. zur Assyr.," VI., No.5. p. 22); and in a list of proper names of the same period (cf. "Cun.Texts," VI., pl. 23) a Kassite man, (_awîl_) ṣâbum Kashshû, bears thename Warad-Ibari, perhaps a Semitic rendering of an original Kassitename.][Footnote 4: Cf. Ingnad, "Vorderas.

Thureau-Dangin, "Journal des Savants." Nouv. Sér., VI., No. 4, pp.100 ff., and "Zeits. für Assyr.," XXI., pp. 170 ff. The establishedgenealogy of Agum-kakrime renders it impossible to identify the Agum ofthe chronicle, who was a son of Kashtiliash the Kassite, with eitherof the Kassite kings of Babylon who bore that name. He can only haveraided or ruled in the Sea-Country, probably at the time his eldestbrother Ushshi (or perhaps his other brother, Abi-rattash) was king inBabylon.][Footnote 8: Agum-kakrime describes Kashtiliash as _aplu,_ probably"the inheritor." not _mâru,_ "the son," of Agum I. (cf. Thureau-Dangin,"Journ. Asiat.," XI., 1908, p. 133 f.).][Footnote 9: See Weissbach, "Babylonische Miscellen," p. 7, pl. 1, No.3.][Footnote 10: Cf.

Deutsch. Orient-Gesellschaft," No. 35, Dec. 1907, is stillthe only publication on the linguistic material that has appeared. Thetopographical and part of the archæological results of the excavationshave now been published; see Puchstein, "Boghasköi," 1912.][Footnote 15: Among the royal letters from Tell el-Amarna are elevenwhich directly concern Babylon. Two of these are drafts, or copies, ofletters which Amenhetep III. despatched to Kadashman-Enlil of Babylon(cf. Kundtzon, _op. cit.,_ pp. 60 ff., 74 ff.); three are lettersreceived by Amen-hetep III. from the same correspondent (_op. cit.,_pp. 66 ff., 68 ff., 72 ff.); five are letters written by Burna-Buriashof Babylon to Amen-hetep IV. or Akhenaten (_op. cit.,_ pp. 78 ff.); andone is a letter from Burna-Buriash, which may have been addressed toAmen-hetep III. (_op. cit.,_ 78 f.). We also possess a letter, from aprincess in Babylon to her lord in Egypt, on a purely domestic matter(_op. cit.,_ pp. 118 ff.), as well as long lists of presents whichpassed between Akhenaten and Burna-Buriash (_op. cit.,_ pp. 100 ff.);one of the letters also appears to be a Babylonian passport for use inCanaan (see below, p. 225, n. 3). The letters thus fall in the reignsof two Kassite rulers, Kadashman-Enlil I. and Burna-Buriash, but fromone of Burna-Buriash's letters to Akhenaten we gather that Amen-hetepIII. had corresponded with a still earlier king in Babylon, Kara-indashI.; for the letter begins by assuring the Pharaoh that "since thetime of Kara-indash, when their fathers had begun to correspond withone another, they had always been good friends" (cf. Knudtzon, _op.cit.,_ pp. 90 ff.). We have recovered no letters of Kurigalzu, thefather of Burna-Buriash, though Amen-hetep III. maintained friendlyrelations with him (see below, p. 224). In a letter of Amen-hetep III.to Kadashman-Enlil reference is also made to correspondence between thetwo countries in the time of Amen-hetep III.'s father, Thothmes IV.(_op. cit.,_ p. 64 f.).][Footnote 16: The Babylonian king expresses his willingness to receiveany beautiful Egyptian woman, as no one would know she was not a king'sdaughter (_op. cit.,_ p. 72 f.). Amen-hetep III. married a sister ofKadashman-Enlil, though the Babylonian court was not satisfied with thelady's treatment in Egypt (_op. cit.,_ p. 60 f.).][Footnote 17: _Op. cit.,_ pp. 178 ff.][Footnote 18: See below, p. 240.][Footnote 19: Cf. Breasted, "Hist. of Egypt," p. 367 f.][Footnote 20: See Knudtzon, _op. cit.,_ p. 128 f.][Footnote 21: _Op. cit.,_ p. 88 f.][Footnote 22: Knudtzon, _op. cit.,_ pp. 88 ff.][Footnote 23: See below, p. 241.][Footnote 24: Cf. Knudtzon, _op. cit.,_ p. 84 f.][Footnote 25: This was a Canaanite city built by Akhenaten, and namedby him Akhetaten, in honour of the Solar Disk.][Footnote 26: _Op. cit.,_ p. 86 f. An interesting little letteraddressed "to the kings of Canaan, the servants of my brother,"was apparently a passport carried by Akia, an ambassador, whom theBabylonian king had sent to condole with the king of Egypt, probablyon the death of his father Amen-hetep III. In it the king writes, "letnone detain him; speedily may they cause him to arrive in Egypt" (cf._op. cit.,_ pp. 268 ff.)][Footnote 27: We are not here concerned with this aspect of theletters, as Babylon had but a remote interest in the internalpolitics of Canaan. Her activities in the west at this time weremainly commercial; and the resulting influence of her civilization inPalestine is discussed in a later chapter (see below, pp. 289 ff.). Theletters will be treated more fully in the third volume of this history,when tracing the gradual expansion of Assyria in the west, and theforces which delayed her inevitable conflict with Egypt.][Footnote 28: See Figs. 47 and 48. The relief was found by M. Legrainat Karnak; cf. Meyer, "Reich und Kultur der Chetiter," pl. i. Theinscription in Fig. 47 labels the ambassadors as "_mariana_ of Naharain(_i.e._ Northern Syria)." the term _mariana_ being the Aryan word for"young men, warriors," doubtless borrowed from the ruling dynastyof Mitanni (see below, n. 2). That in Fig. 48 contains the end of alist of Hittite cities, including [Car]chemish and Aruna, the latterprobably in Asia Minor.][Footnote 29: See Figs. 49 and 50.][Footnote 30: The Mitannian people were probably akin to them,though in the fifteenth century they were dominated by a dynastyof Indo-European extraction, bearing Aryan names and worshippingthe Aryan gods Mitra and Varuna, Indra and the Nâsatya-twins (cf.Winckler, "Mitteil. d. Deutsch. Orient-Gesellschaft," No. 35, p. 51,and Meyer, _op. cit.,_ p. 57 f.). In spite of Scheftelowitz's attemptto prove the Mitannian speech Aryan (cf. "Zeits. f. vergl. Sprachf.,"xxxviii., pp. 260 ff.), it has been shown by Bloomfield to be totallynon-Indo-European in character; see "Amer. Journ. of Philol.," xxv.,pp. 4 ff., and cf. Meyer, "Zeits. f. vergl. Sprachf.," xlii., 21, andKing, "Journ. for Hellen. Stud.," xxxiii., p. 359.][Footnote 31: Khatti may well have been an important centre from avery early period, and the use of the name "Hittites" by the latechronicler, in describing the conflicts of the First BabylonianDynasty, is in favour of this view: see above, p. 210, n. 2.][Footnote 32: This we gather from a letter Amen-hetep wrote to him inthe Arzawa language, which was found at Tell el-Amarna; cf. Knudtzon,"Die el-Amarna Tafeln," pp. 270 ff., No. 31.][Footnote 33: A portion of the village is built over an extension ofthe outer fortification-walls on the north-west.][Footnote 34: Now known as Beuyuk Kale.

Puchstein, "Boghasköi," pi. 23 f.). The figuresculptured in relief on the inner side of the Royal Gateway (see p.229, Fig. 51) preserves an interesting feature of the best Hittitework,--an unusual combination of minute surface-adornment with greatboldness of design. The hatching and scroll-work on the garment areonly roughly indicated in the small drawing, and other detail isomitted. Hair on the breast of the figure, for example, doubtlessregarded as a sign of strength and virility, is conventionally renderedby series of minute overlapping curls, which form a diapered patterntraced with the point. This can only be detected on the original stone,or in a large-size photograph, such as that reproduced by Puchstein,_op. cit.,_ pl. 19. The Royal Gateway is in the S.E. corner of thecity, near the palace and the smaller temples. The great temple, byfar the largest building on the site, lies on the lower ground to thenorth.][Footnote 36: Cf. Winckler, "Mitteil. d. Deutsch. Orient-Gesellschaft,"No. 35, p. 36.][Footnote 37: The disastrous opening of the battle was largely due tothe over-confidence of Rameses and his complete miscalculation of theenemy's strength and resources; for the Egyptians had never yet metso powerful an enemy as the Hittites proved themselves to be. Withthe help of the reliefs it is possible to follow the tactics of theopposing armies in some detail. The accompanying inscriptions are veryfragmentary, but they are supplemented by a historical account of thebattle, introducing a poem in celebration of the valour of Rameses,preserved on a papyrus in the British Museum. For a detailed accountof the battle, illustrated by plans and accompanied by translations ofthe texts, see Breasted, "Ancient Records of Egypt," Vol. 111., pp. 123ff.; cp. also Budge, "History," Vol. V., pp. 20 ff., and Hall, "NearEast," p. 360 f.][Footnote 38: Cf.

Naturally they were supplied by Egypt and Babylon, as the twogreat centres of science and learning. Thus Khattusil refers to aphysician _(asû)_ and an exorcist _(ashipu),_ who had formerly beensent from Babylon to the Hittite king Mutallu but had not returned.Kadashman-Enlil had evidently written to enquire about them, andKhattusil replies that the exorcist is dead, but that the physicianwill be sent back; cf. Winckler, _op. cit.,_ p. 26. Medicine atthis time was, of course, merely a branch of magic, and the _asû_ apractising magician; see above, p. 194.][Footnote 43: We possess no contemporary reference to Khonsu's journey.The tale is recorded on a stele, now in the Bibliothèque Nationale,which was engraved and set up in the Persian or Hellenic period by thepriests of Khonsu at Thebes (cf. Breasted, "Ancient Records," III., pp.188 ff.). At the head of the stele is a relief showing the two sacredboats of Khonsu borne on the shoulders of priests (see p. 238 f., Figs.56 f.).][Footnote 44: Evidence of increased Egyptian influence may be seen inthe fact that, to judge from the seals upon a Hittite document (cf.Winckler, _op. cit.,_ p. 29), Arnuanta appears to have adopted theEgyptian custom of marrying his sister.][Footnote 45: See above, p. 221.][Footnote 46: Cf.

The document isof considerable importance, as the reading of Kadashman-Enlil's nameupon it has cleared up several points of uncertainty connected with thevexed subject of the Kassite succession.][Footnote 50: A red marble mace-head, discovered at Babylon (cf.Weissbach, "Bab. Miscellen," pp. 2 ff.), is inscribed with his nameand that of his father. Neither bears a royal title in the text,but, as this is sometimes omitted in the Kassite period, Meli-Shipakmay be provisionally regarded as the successor of Kurigalzu I.; cf.Thureau-Dangin, "Journ. Asiat.," XI. (1908), p. 119 f.][Footnote 51: Cf. "Annals," p. xxii.][Footnote 52: _Op. cit.,_ p. xxiii. In the interval between Kara-indashI. and Burna-Buriash are to be set Kadashman-Enlil I. and his son,[....Bu]riash (see Hilprecht, "Old Bab. Inscr.," I., i., pl. 25, No.68, and cp. Thureau-Dangin, _op. cit.,_ pp. 122 ff.), as well asKurgalzu II. the father of Burna-Buriash (see above, pp. 221, 224).][Footnote 53: Cf. "Annals," p. xxvii. The account given by theSynchronistic History is certainly to be preferred to that of theChronicle 82-7-4, 38. The discrepancies are best explained on theassumption that the latter's editor has confused Kurigalzu, the youngson of Hurna-Buriash, with Kurigalzu I., the son of Kadashman-KharbeI., to whom the chronicler's ascription of success against the Sutûshould be transferred (see Thureau-Dangin, "Journ. Asiat.," XI., 1908,pp. 125 if., and cp. Knudtzon, "Die El-Amarna-Tafeln," p. 34, n. 2).][Footnote 54: He was no doubt elated by his successful war with Elam,in the course of which he captured Khurpatila, the Elamite king; cf.Delitzsch, "Das Bab.

But the older territorial divisions of Sumer and Akkadstill survived as geographical terms and in the royal titles.][Footnote 58: Cf. King, "Records of Tukulti-Ninib I.," pp. 96 ff.][Footnote 59: The short reigns of Enlil-nadin-shum, Kadashman-KhabeII. and Adad-shum-iddin must be regarded as falling partly within theperiod of Tukulti-Ninib's troubled years of suzerainty, partly in thereign of Tukulti-Ashur, when the statue of Marduk, carried off byTukulti-Ninib, was restored to Babylon. The reign of Enlil-nadin-shumwas cut short by Kidin-Khutrutash of Elam, who sacked Nippur and Dêr,while a few years later the same Elamite monarch penetrated stillfurther into Babylonia after defeating Adad-shum-iddin; cf. Delitzsch,"Das Bab. Chron.," p. 46.][Footnote 60: "Annals," p. xli.][Footnote 61: The name in the Kings' List reads _Bêl-nadin-_(....);and in the fragmentary inscription in which Nebuchadnezzar recordshow he turned the tables upon Elam, he refers to a ruler, between(Zamama)-shum-iddin and himself, as _(ilu)BE-nadin-akhi_ (seeRawlinson, "Cun. Inscr. West Asia," III., pl. 38, No. 2, and cf.Winckler, "Altorientalische Forschungen," I., pp. 534 ff.). The divineideogram _(ilu)BE_ was read as Ea by the Babylonians and as Enlil bythe Assyrians. And the identification of the two royal names has beencalled in question on the grounds that the Assyrian copy, in whichNebuchadnezzar's text has come down to us, would have reproduced theBabylonian orthography of its original, and that in any case it isdoubtful whether Enlil, like Marduk, ever bore the synonymous titleof Bêl (cf. Thureau-Dangin, "Journ. Asiat.," XI., p. 132 f.). If wereject the identification, we should read the name of the last king ofthe Kassite Dynasty as Ea-nadin-[....], and regard Bêl-nadin-akhi asprobably the second or third ruler of the Fourth Dynasty.][Footnote 62: The contracts and letters of this period closely resemblethose of the time of the First Dynasty. The dated documents havefurnished a means of controlling the figures assigned in the Kings'List to the later Kassite rulers; see Clay, "Documents from the TempleArchives of Nippur," in the "Bab.

Themethod of marking out the limits of a field or estate by means ofboundary-stones, or boundary-tablets, is common among peoples whohave abandoned nomad life for agriculture; and the further idea ofinscribing the owner's name and title to the land is one that wouldnaturally suggest itself.][Footnote 70: This is suggested by the fact that the symbols and cursesso often do not correspond; had they both been bound up in a likeorigin, we should have expected the one to illustrate the other moreclosely.][Footnote 71: It was quite optional on the part of a Kassite landownerto engrave a boundary-stone, and, if he did so, it was simply to secureadditional protection for his title. This is well illustrated by akudurru of the reign of Nazi-maruttash (see Plate XXI.), which was onlyengraved after the original clay title-deed had been destroyed by thefall of the building in which it had been preserved.][Footnote 72: See Plate XXI., opposite; and cp.

This view appears preferable to the theory that the land grantedby the Kassite kings was taken from communal or public laud of a city,or district, of which the king had the right to dispose (cf. Hincke,"Boundary Stone of Nebuchadnezzar I.," p. 16).][Footnote 75: See above, p. 247.]CHAPTER VIIITHE LATER DYNASTIES AND THE ASSYRIAN DOMINATIONThe historian of ancient Babylonia has reason to be grateful toShutruk-Nakhkhunte and his son for their raids into the Euphratesvalley, since certain of the monuments they carried off as spoil havebeen preserved in the mounds of Susa, until the French expeditionbrought them again to light. Thanks to Babylon's misfortunes at thistime, we have recovered some of her finest memorials, including thefamous Stele of Narâm-Sin, Hammurabi's Code of Laws, and an importantseries of the Kassite kudurrus, or boundary-stones, which, as wehave seen, throw considerable light upon the economic condition ofthe country. These doubtless represent but a small proportion of thebooty secured by Elam at this period, but they suffice to show themanner in which the great Babylonian cities were denuded of theirtreasures. Under the earlier kings of the Fourth Dynasty it wouldseem that Elam continued to be a menace, and it was not until thereign of Nebuchadnezzar I. that the land was freed from furtherdanger of Elamite invasion. We possess two interesting memorials ofhis successful campaigns, during which he not only regained his ownterritories, but carried the war into the enemy's country. One is acharter of privileges, which the king conferred upon Ritti-Marduk, theCaptain of his chariots, for signal service against Elam. The text isengraved on a block of calcareous limestone, and on one side of it area series of divine symbols, sculptured in high relief, in order toplace the record under the protection of the gods, in accordance withthe custom introduced during the Kassite period. The campaign in Elamwhich furnished the occasion for the charter was undertaken, accordingto the text,[1] with the object of "avenging Akkad," that is to say, inretaliation for the Elamite raids in Northern Babylonia. The campaignwas conducted from the frontier city of Dêr, or Dûr-ilu, and, as it wascarried out in the summer, the Babylonian army suffered considerablyon the march. The heat of the sun was so great that, in the words ofthe record, the axe burned like fire, the roads scorched like flame,and through the lack of drinking-water "the vigour of the great horsesfailed, and the legs of the strong man turned aside." Ritti-Marduk,as Captain of the chariots, encouraged the troops by his example, andeventually brought them to the Euheus, where they gave battle to theElamite confederation which had been summoned to oppose them.The record describes the subsequent battle in vivid phraseology."The kings took their stand round about and offered battle. Firewas kindled in their midst; by their dust was the face of the sundarkened. The hurricane sweeps along, the storm rages; in the storm oftheir battle the warrior in the chariot perceives not the companionat his side." Here again Ritti-Marduk did good service by leading theattack. "He turned evil against the King of Elam, so that destructionovertook him; King Nebuchadnezzar triumphed, he captured the land ofElam, he plundered its possessions." On his return from the campaignNebuchadnezzar granted the charter to Ritti-Marduk, freeing the townsand villages of Bît-Karziabku, of which he was the head-man, fromthe jurisdiction of the neighbouring town of Namar. In addition tofreedom from all taxation and the _corvée,_ the privileges secured theinhabitants from liability to arrest by imperial soldiers stationedin the district, and forbade the billeting of such troops upon them.This portion of the text affords an interesting glimpse of the militaryorganization of the kingdom.The second memorial too has a bearing on this war, since it exhibitsNebuchadnezzar as a patron of Elamite refugees. It is a copy of adeed recording a grant of land and privileges to Shamfia and hisson Shamfiia, priests of the Elamite god Rîa, who, in fear of theElamite king, fled from their own country and secured Nebuchadnezzar'sprotection. The text states that, when the king undertook an expeditionon their behalf, they accompanied him and brought back the statue ofthe god Rîa, whose cult Nebuchadnezzar inaugurated in the Babyloniancity of Khuṣṣi, after he had introduced the foreign god into Babylon atthe Feast of the New Year. The deed records the grant of five estatesto the two Elamite priests and their god, and it exempts the land infuture from all liability to taxation and forced labour.[2]Though Nebuchadnezzar restored the fortunes of his country, he wasnot the founder of his dynasty,[3] Of his three predecessors, thename of one may now be restored as Marduk-shapik-zêrim. His namehas been read on a kudurru-fragment in the Yale Collection, whichis dated in the eighth year of Marduk-nadin-akhê, and refers to thetwelfth year of Marduk-shapik-zêrim.[4] That he cannot be identifiedwith Marduk-shapik-zêr-mâti is certain, since we know from the"Synchronistic History" that the latter succeeded Marduk-nadin-akhêupon the throne of Babylon, the one being the contemporary ofTiglath-pileser I., the other of his son Ashur-bêl-kala.[5] The closesequence of the reigns of Nebuchadnezzar I., Enlil-nadin-apli, andMarduk-nadin-akhê has long been recognized from the occurrence of thesame officials on legal documents of the period.[6] We must thereforeplace the newly recovered ruler in the gap before Nebuchadnezzar I.;he must be one of the first three kings of the dynasty, possibly itsfounder, whose name in the Kings' List begins with the divine titleMarduk, and who ruled for seventeen years according to the sameauthority. Another of these missing rulers may perhaps be restoredas Ea-nadin-[....], if the royal name in the broken inscription ofNebuchadnezzar I., to which reference has already been made,[7] is tobe read in that way and not identified as that of the last member ofthe Kassite Dynasty. During the earlier years of the Dynasty of IsinBabylonia must have been subject to further Elamite aggression, andportions of the country may for a time have acknowledged the suzeraintyof her rulers.[Illustration: DIVINE EMBLEMS ON A CHARTER OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR I. Brit.Mus., No. 90858.]Nebuchadnezzar's successes against Elam and the neighbouring districtof Lulubu[8] no doubt enabled him to offer a more vigorous defence ofhis northern frontier; and, when Ashur-rêsh-ishi attempted an invasionof Babylonian territory, he not only drove the Assyrians back, butfollowed them up and laid siege to the frontier fortress of Zanki. ButAshur-rêsh-ishi forced him to raise the siege and burn his siege-train;and, on Nebuchadnezzar's return with reinforcements, the Babylonianarmy suffered a further defeat, losing its fortified camp together withKarashtu, the general in command of the army, who was taken to Assyriaas a prisoner of war. Babylon thus proved that, though strong enough torecover and maintain her independence, she was incapable of a vigorousoffensive on a large scale. It is true that Nebuchadnezzar claimedamong his titles that of "Conqueror of Amurru,"[9] but it is doubtfulwhether we should regard the term as implying more than a raid into theregion of the middle Euphrates.[10]That within her own borders Babylon maintained an effectiveadministration is clear from a boundary-stone of the period ofNebuchadnezzar's successor, Enlil-nadin-apli, recording a grant of landin the district of Edina in Southern Babylonia by E-anna-shum-iddina, agovernor of the Sea-Country, who administered that district under theBabylonian king and owed his appointment to him.[11] But in the reignof Marduk-nadin-akhê, she was to suffer her second great defeat at thehands of Assyria. She fought two campaigns with Tiglath-pileser I.,in the latter part of his reign, after his successes in the North andWest.[12] In the first she met with some success,[13] but on the secondoccasion Tiglath-pileser completely reversed its result, and followedup his victory by the capture of Babylon itself with other of the greatnorthern cities, Dûr-Kurigalzu, Sippar of Shamash, Sippar of Anunitum,and Opis. But Assyria did not then attempt a permanent occupation,for we find Tiglath-pileser's son, Ashur-bêl-kala, on friendly termswith Marduk-shapik-zêr-mâti; and when the latter, after a prosperousreign,[14] lost his throne to the Aramean usurper Adad-aplu-iddina,[15]he further strengthened the alliance by contracting a marriage with thenew king's daughter.[16]Thus closed the first phase of Babylon's relations with the growingAssyrian power. A state of alternate conflict and temporary truce hadbeen maintained between them for some three centuries, and now formore than half a century the internal condition of both countrieswas such as to put an end to any policy of aggression. The cause ofBabylon's decline was the overrunning of the country by the Sutû,semi-nomad Semitic tribes from beyond the Euphrates,[17] who made theirfirst descent during Adad-aplu-iddina's later years, and, accordingto a Neo-Babylonian chronicle, carried off with them the spoil ofSumer and Akkad. This was probably the first of many raids, and wemay see evidence of the unsettled condition of the country in theephemeral Babylonian dynasties, which followed one another in quicksuccession.[18]The later ruler, Nabû-aplu-iddina, when recording his rebuilding of thegreat temple of the Sun-god at Sippar,[19] has left us some details ofthis troubled time; and the facts he relates of one of the great citiesof Akkad may be regarded as typical of the general condition of thecountry. The temple had been wrecked by the Sutû, doubtless at the timeof Adad-aplu-iddina, and it was not until the reign of Simmash-Shipak,who came from the Country of the Sea and founded the Fifth Dynasty,[20]that any attempt was made to reestablish the interrupted service ofthe deity. His successor, Ea-mukîn-zêr, did not retain the throne formore than five months, and in the reign of Kashshûnadin-akhi, withwhom the dynasty closed, the country suffered further misfortunes, thegeneral distress, occasioned by raids and civil disturbance, beingincreased by famine. Thus the service of the temple again suffered,until under E-ulmash-shakin-shum of Bît-Bazi, who founded the SixthDynasty, a partial re-endowment of the temple took place. But its halfruinous condition continued to attest the poverty of the country andof its rulers, until the more prosperous times of Nabû-aplu-iddina.E-ulmash-shakin-shum was succeeded by two members of his own house,Ninib-kudur-usur and Shilanum-Shuḳamuna; but they reigned between themless than four years, and the throne then passed for six years to anElamite,[21] whose rule is regarded by the later chroniclers as havingconstituted in itself the Seventh Babylonian Dynasty.[Illustration: FIG. 58.SCENE REPRESENTING NABÛ-MUKÎN-APLI SANCTIONING A TRANSFER OF LANDEDPROPERTY.Arad-Sibitti, accompanied by his sister, receives the royal sanction tothe transfer of an estate, situated in the district of Sha-mamîtu, tohis daughter as her dowry.(From Boundary-Stone No. 90835 in the British Museum.)]A stable government was once more established in Babylonia byNabû-mukîn-apli, the founder of the Eighth Dynasty,[22] though evenin his reign Aramean tribes continued to give trouble, holding theEuphrates in the neighbourhood of Babylon and Borsippa, cuttingcommunications, and raiding the country-side. On one occasion theycaptured the Ferry-Gate of Kâr-bêlmâtâti and prevented the king fromholding the New Year's Festival, as the statue of the god Nabû couldnot be transported across the river to Babylon.[23] A rude portrait ofthis monarch is preserved on a boundary-stone of his reign, on which heis represented giving the royal sanction to the transfer of an estatein the district of Sha-mamîtu; and it may be added that considerablefriction subsequently took place, with regard to the validity of thetitle, between the original owner Arad-Sibitti and his son-in-law, ajewel-worker named Burusha.[24] The coarse style of the engraving isprobably to be explained by the fact of its provincial origin, thoughthere can be little doubt that the standard of Babylonian art had beenadversely affected by the internal condition of the country during thepreceding period.It was at the time of the Eighth Dynasty that the renaissance ofAssyria took place, which culminated in the victories of that ruthlessconqueror Ashur-nasir-pal and of his son Shalmaneser III. Its effectwas first felt in Babylon in the reign of Shamash-mudammik, whosuffered a serious defeat in the neighbourhood of Mt. Ialman at thehands of Adad-nirari III., Ashur-nasir-pal's grandfather. AgainstNabû-shum-ishkun I., the murderer and successor of Shamash-mudammik,Adad-nirari secured another victory, several Babylonian cities withmuch spoil falling into his hands. But we subsequently find him onfriendly terms with Babylon, and allying himself with Nabû-shum-ishkun,or possibly with his successor, each monarch marrying the othersdaughter.[25] His son Tukulti-Ninib II. of Assyria, profiting by therenewed sense of security from attack upon his southern border, beganto make tentative efforts at expanding westwards into Mesopotamia. Butit was reserved for Ashur-nasir-pal, his son, to cross the Euphratesand lead Assyrian armies once more into Syrian territory. Aftersecuring his frontier to the east and north of Assyria, Ashur-nasir-palturned his attention to the west. The Aramean states of Bît-Khadippiand Bît-Adini, both on the left bank of the Euphrates, fell before hisonslaught. Then crossing the Euphrates on rafts of skins, he receivedthe submission of Sangar of Carchemish, and marched in triumph throughSyria to the coast.Babylon naturally viewed this encroachment on the Euphrates routeto the west as a danger to her commercial connexions, and it is notsurprising that Nabû-aplu-iddina should have attempted to opposeAshur-nasir-pal's advance by allying himself with Shadudu of Sukhi.[26]But the armed forces he sent to support the people of Sukhi in theirresistance were quite unable to withstand the Assyrian onslaught, andhis brother Sabdanu and Bêl-aplu-iddin, the Babylonian leader, fellinto Ashur-nasir-pal's hands. In recording his victory the Assyrianking refers to the Babylonians as the Kassites,[27] a striking tributeto the fame of the foreign dynasty which had ended more than threecenturies before. Nabû-aplu-iddina evidently realized the futilityof attempting further opposition to Assyrian aims, and he was gladto establish relations of a friendly character, which he continuedin the reign of Shalmaneser. He attempted to forget the failure ofhis military expedition by repairing the damage inflicted during thenumerous Aramean raids upon the ancient cult-centres of Babylonia.[Illustration: MEMORIAL TABLET OF NABÛ-APLU-IDDINA, RECORDING HISRESTORATION OF THE SUN-TEMPLE AT SIPPAR. _Brit. Mus._ No., 91000.]He is the king who restored and re-endowed so richly the temple ofShamash at Sippar, digging in the ruins of former structures till hefound the ancient image of the god. He redecorated the shrine, andwith much ceremony re-established the ritual and offerings for the god,placing them under the control of Nabû-nadin-shum, a descendant of theformer priest E-kur-shum-ushabshi, whom Simmash-Shipak had installedat Sippar. The sculptured scene on the stone memorial-tablet, whichrecords the re-endowment of the temple, represents Nabû-aplu-iddinabeing led by the priest Nabû-nadin-shum and the goddess Aia into thepresence of the Sun-god, who is seated in his temple E-babbar.[Illustration: FIG. 59.MARDUK AND HIS DRAGON FROM A VOTIVE OFFERING OF MARDUK-ZAKIR-SHUM.(After Weissbach.)]Before the god is the solar disk resting upon an altar supported byattendant deities, whose bodies spring from the roof of the shrine.[28]The skill of the Babylonian craftsmen at this period is also attestedby a cylinder of lapis-lazuli, engraved in low relief with a figure ofMarduk and his dragon, which was dedicated in E-sagila at Babylon byMarduk-zakir-shum, the son and successor of Nabû-aplu-iddina. It wasoriginally coated with gold, and the design and execution of the figuremay be compared with those of the Sun-god Tablet, as an additionalexample of the decorative character of Babylonian stone-engraving inthe ninth century.It was in Marduk-zakir-shum's reign that Assyria capped herconquests of this period by becoming the suzerain of Babylon. UnderAshur-naṣir-pal and Shalmaneser the military organization of thecountry had been renewed, and both made effective use of theirextraordinarily efficient armies. Ashur-nasir-pal's policy was one ofannihilation, and the speed with which he struck ensured his success.Thus when he crossed the Euphrates after taking Carchemish, the kingof Damascus, the most powerful and important state in Syria, made noattempt to oppose him or to organize a defence. He had evidently beentaken by surprise.[Illustration: FIG. 60.THE ASSYRIAN ARMY IN CHALDEA, 851 B.C.In the upper register Assyrian foot-soldiers and cavalry are seencrossing a stream by a bridge of boats, while below the army isrepresented leaving its fortified camp.(From the Gates of Shalmaneser in the British Museum.)] But Syria thenlearned her lesson, and at the battle of Karkar in 854 B.C. Shalmaneserfound himself opposed by a confederation of the northern kings, and,though he eventually succeeded in ravaging the territory of Damascus,the city itself held out. In fact, the stubborn resistance of Damascusprevented any further attempt on Assyria's part at this period topenetrate further into Southern Syria and Palestine. So Shalmaneserhad to content himself with marching northwards across Mt. Amanus,subjugating Cilicia and exacting tribute from districts north of theTaurus. He also conducted a successful campaign in Armenia, from whichquarter one of Assyria's most powerful enemies was about to arise. Butit was in Babylonia that he secured his principal political success.He has left us a pictorial record of his campaigns on the bronzesheathing of two cedar-wood doors of his palace; and, as one of thebands commemorates his triumphal march through Chaldea in 851 b.c., itgives us some indication of the condition of the country at this time.[Illustration: FIG. 61.A CHALDEAN TOWN OF THE NINTH CENTURY B.C.The male inhabitants are represented leaving with cattle and tributefor Shalmaneser III., while the women watch them from the walls.(From the Gates of Shalmaneser.)]The occasion for Shalmaneser's intervention in Babylonian affairswas furnished by internal dissension.[29] When Marduk-bêl-usâte, thebrother of Marduk-zakir-shum, revolted, and divided the country intotwo armed camps, Shalmaneser readily responded to the latter's appealfor help, and marching southwards succeeded in defeating the rebels andin ravaging the districts under their control. On a second expeditionin the following year he completed his work by slaying Marduk-bel-usâtein battle, and he was then acknowledged by Marduk-zakir-shum as hissuzerain. In this capacity he toured through the principal cities ofAkkad, offering sacrifices in the famous temples of Cuthah, Babylon,and Borsippa. He also led his army into Chaldea, and, after stormingits frontier fortress of Bakâni, received the submission of its ruler,Adini, and heavy tribute from him and from Iakin, the Chaldean kingof the Sea-Country further to the south. In his representation of thecampaign Shalmaneser is portrayed marching through the country, andreceiving tribute from the Chaldeans, which they carry from theircities and ferry across streams to deposit in the presence of the kingand his officials.[Illustration FIGS. 62 AND 63.THE TRIBUTE OF THE CHALDEANS,In Fig. 62 Chaldeans are represented conveying tribute across a streamin boats; in Fig. 63 they deposit it at a bridge-head held by theAssyrians.(From the Gates of Shalmaneser.)]But Babylon did not long endure the position of a vassal state,and Shalmaneser's son and successor. Shamshi-Adad IV., attemptedher reconquest, plundering many cities before he met with seriousopposition. Marduk-balâtsu-ikbi, the Babylonian king, had meanwhilecollected his forces, which included armed levies from Elam, Chaldea,and other districts. The two armies met near the city of Dûr-Papsukal,the Babylonians were totally defeated, and a rich booty fell to theirconqueror. During a subsequent interregnum Erba-Marduk, the son ofMarduk-shakin-shum, secured the throne, owing his election to hissuccess in driving Aramean raiders from the cultivated fields ofBabylon and Borsippa.[30] But he did not reign for long, and whenBabylon continued to give trouble to Assyria, Adad-nirari IV., thesuccessor of Shamshi-Adad, again subjugated a considerable portion ofthe country, carrying away Bau-akhi-iddina, the Babylonian king, as acaptive to Assyria, together with the treasures of his palace.[31]During the following half-century our knowledge of Babylonian affairsis a blank, and we have not as yet recovered even the names of the lastmembers of the Eighth Dynasty. This epoch corresponds to a period ofweakness and inaction in the northern kingdom, such as more than oncebefore had followed a forward movement on her part. The expansion ofAssyria, in fact, took place in a series of successive waves, and whenone had spent itself, a recoil preceded the next advance. The principalcause of her contraction, after the brilliant reigns of ShalmaneserIII. and his father, may undoubtedly be traced to the rise of a newpower in the mountains of Armenia. From their capital on the shore ofLake Van, the Urartians marched southward and menaced the northernfrontier of Assyria itself. Her kings could no longer dream of furtheradventures in the West, which would leave their home territory atthe mercy of this new foe. Urartu became now the principal drag onAssyria's ambitions, a part which was afterwards so effectively playedby Elam in alliance with Babylon.It is to this period we may probably assign an interesting provincialmonument, discovered in Babylon,[32] which illustrates the independentposition enjoyed by the rulers of local districts at a time when thecentral control of either kingdom, and particularly of Assyria, wasrelaxed. The monument commemorates the principal achievements ofShamash-rêsh-usur, governor of the lands of Sukhi and Mari on themiddle Euphrates.[33] He may have owed his appointment to Assyria,but he speaks like a reigning monarch and dates the record in histhirteenth year.[Illustration: FIG. 64.BAS-RELIEF OF SHAMASH-RÊSH-USUR, GOVERNOR OF THE LANDS OF SUKHI ANDMARI.The scene represents Shamash-rêsh-usur standing before the god Adad andthe goddess Ishtar. The stone was set up in Gabbari-ibni, a city he hadfounded, and it commemorates his achievements, the one of which he wasmost proud being the introduction of honey-bees into the land of Sukhi.(After a photo, by Weissbach.)]On it he records his suppression of a revolt of the Tu'mânu tribe,who threatened his capital Ribanish, while he was holding festivalin the neighbouring town of Baka. But he attacked them with thepeople who were with him, slew three hundred and fifty of them, andthe rest submitted. He also records how he dug out the Sukhi Canal,when it had silted up, and how he planted palm-trees in his palace atRibanish. But his most notable act, according to his own account, wasthe introduction of bees into Sukhi, which his improved irrigation ofthe district doubtless rendered possible. "Bees which collect honey,"he tells us, "which no man had seen since the time of my fathers andforefathers, nor had brought to the land of Sukhi, I brought downfrom the mountains of the Khabkha-tribe and I put them in the gardenof Gabbari-ibni." The text closes with an interesting little note uponthe bees: "They collect honey and wax. The preparing of honey andwax I understand, and the gardeners understand it." And he adds thatin days to come a ruler will ask the elders of his land, "Is it truethat Shamash-rêsh-usur, governor of Sukhi, brought honey-bees into theland of Sukhi?" The monument may well have been carried to Babylon byNebuchadnezzar II., when he incorporated the district within his empire.The subsequent period shows a gradual tightening of Assyria's graspupon the southern kingdom, varied by comparatively ineffectivestruggles and revolts on Babylon's part to avoid her loss ofindependence. The temporary decline of Assyrian power enabledBabylon for a time to regain something of her former position underNabû-shum-ishkun II., an early king of the Ninth Dynasty, and hissuccessor Nabonassar. But the military revolt in Assyria, which in 745B.C. placed Tiglath-pileser IV. upon the throne,[34] put a speedy endto Babylon's hopes of any permanent recovery of power. His accessionmarks the beginning of the last period of Assyrian expansion, andthe administrative policy he inaugurated justifies us in ascribingthe term "empire" to the area conquered by him, and his successors,in the last half of the eighth and the first half of the seventhcenturies B.C. But it was an empire which carried in itself from theoutset the seeds of decay. It was based on a policy of deportation,Assyria's final answer to her pressing problem of how to administerthe wide areas she annexed. Former Assyrian kings had carried away theconquered into slavery, but Tiglath-pileser IV. inaugurated a regulartransference of nations. The policy certainly effected its immediateobject: it kept the subject provinces quiet. But as a permanent methodof administration it was bound to be a failure. While destroyingpatriotism and love of country, it put an end at the same time toall incentives to labour. The subject country's accumulated wealthhad already been drained for the benefit of Assyrian coffers; and inthe hands of its half-starved colonists it was not likely to prove apermanent source of strength, or of wealth, to its suzerain.Tiglath-pileser's first object, before launching his armies tothe north and west, was to secure his southern frontier, and thishe effected by invading Babylonia and forcing from Nabonassar anacknowledgment of Assyrian control. During the campaign he overran thenorthern districts, and applied his policy of deportation by carryingaway many of their inhabitants. The distress in the country, due tothe Assyrian inroads, was aggravated by internal dissension. Sipparrepudiated Nabonassar's authority, and the revolt was subdued onlyafter a siege of the city.[35] The Ninth Dynasty ended with the countryin confusion; for Nabû-nadin-zêr, Nabopolassar's son, after a reign ofonly two years, was slain in a revolt by Nabû-shum-ukin, the governorof a province.[36] The dynasty soon came to an end after the latter'saccession. He had not enjoyed his position for more than a month, whenthe kingdom again changed hands, and Nabû-mukîn-zêr secured the throne.From the fall of the Ninth Dynasty, until the rise of theNeo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonia was completely overshadowed bythe power of Assyria. She became merely a subject province of theempire, and her Tenth Dynasty is mainly composed of Assyrian rulersor their nominees. Nabû-mukîn-zêr had reigned only three years whenTiglath-pileser again invaded Babylonia, took him captive, and ascendedthe throne of Babylon, where he ruled under his name of Pulu.[37]On his death, which occurred two years later, he was succeeded byShalmaneser V., who, as suzerain of Babylon, adopted the name ofUlulai. But Babylonia soon demonstrated her power of hinderingAssyrian plans, for, after the elose of Shalmaneser's reign, whenSargon's army had secured the capture of Samaria, he was obliged torecall his forces from the West by the menace of his southern province.Merodach-baladan, a Chaldean chief of Bît-Iakin[38] at the head ofthe Persian Gulf, now laid claim to the throne of Babylon. By himselfhe would not have been formidable to Assyria, but he was backed byan unexpected and dangerous ally. Elam had not meddled in Babylonianaffairs for centuries, but she had gradually become alarmed at thegrowth of Assyrian power. So Khumbanigash, the Elamite king, allyinghimself with Merodach-baladan, invaded Babylonia, laid siege to thefrontier fortress of Dêr or Dûr-ilu on the Lower Tigris, and defeatedSargon and the Assyrian army before its walls. Merodach-baladan wasacknowledged by the Babylonians as their king, and he continued to be athorn in the side of Assyria.[Illustration: SHALMANESER III RECEIVING THE SUBMISSION OF THECHALDEANS. From the Gates of Shalmaneser in the Brit. Mus.]After the defeat of Shabaka and the Egyptians at Raphia, Sargon wasoccupied with the final subjugation of Urartu in the north, which hadfor so long been a danger to Assyria. But Urartu had to fight, notonly the Assyrians, but also a new enemy, the Cimmerians, who now madetheir appearance from the north and east. In fact, Sargon's conquest ofUrartu resulted in the destruction of that people as a buffer state,and laid Assyria open to the direct attack of the barbarian invaders,though it was not until the reign of Esarhaddon that their activitybegan to be formidable. Meanwhile, having subjugated his other foes.Sargon was able to turn his attention once more to Babylon, fromwhich he expelled Merodach-baladan. His appearance was welcomed bythe priestly party, and, entering the city in state, he assumed thetitle of Governor and for the last seven years of his life he ruled inBabylon virtually as king. A memorial of his occupation survives to-dayin the quay-wall, which he constructed along the north front of theSouthern Citadel.[39]On Sargon's death in 705 B.C. the subject provinces of the empirerebelled. The revolt was led by Babylon, where Merodach-baladanreappears with Elamite support,[40] while Hezekiah of Judah headed aconfederation of the states of Southern Syria. Sennacherib was firstoccupied with Babylon, where he had little difficulty in defeatingMerodach-baladan and his allies. He was then free to deal with Syriaand Palestine; and at Eltekeh, near Ekron, he routed the Egyptian army,which had come to the support of the rebel states. He then receivedthe submission of Ekron, and took Lachish after a siege, though Tyreresisted. After his expulsion from Babylon Merodach-baladan had soughtsafety by hiding himself in the Babylonian swamps, where he alliedhimself with the Chaldean prince Mushezib-Marduk; and Babylon had beenleft in charge of Bêl-ibni, a young native Babylonian, who had beenbrought up at the Assyrian court. A rising, headed by Mushezib-Marduk,brought Sennacherib again into the country, who, after defeating therebels, carried off Bêl-ibni and his nobles to Assyria, leaving his ownson Ashur-nadin-shum upon the throne.The country was in a state of continual disaffection, and after a fewyears a fresh revolt was headed by a Babylonian, Nergal-ushezib. Buthe ruled for little more than a year, being defeated by Sennacheriband sent in chains to Nineveh. This took place after the return of theAssyrian army from Nagitu, whither it had been conveyed by Sennacherib,across the head of the Persian Gulf, against the Chaldeans whomMerodach-baladan had settled there.[41] Sennacherib then turned hisforces against Elam, and, after plundering a considerable portionof the country, he was stopped in his advance into the interior bythe setting in of winter. In his absence the Chaldean Mushezib-Mardukseized the throne of Babylon, and allied himself with Elam. But thecombined armies were defeated at Khalule, and after the death ofUmman-menanu, the Elamite king, in 689, Sennacherib seized Babylon.Exasperated at her disaffection, he attempted to put an end for alltime to her constant menace by destroying the city. He succeeded indoing an enormous amount of damage, and, by deflecting the course ofthe Euphrates, wiped out large areas and turned them into swamps.[42]For the last eight years of Sennacherib's reign the country was givenover to a state of anarchy.[Illustration: FIG. 65. THE GOD ADAD FROM A VOTIVE OFFERING DEDICATEDIN E-SAGILA BY ESARHADDOS.(After Weissbach.)]In 681 Sennacherib was murdered by his sons, and, after a struggle forthe succession, Esarhaddon secured the throne. His first thought was toreverse completely his father's Babylonian policy, and by rebuildingthe city and restoring its ancient privileges to placate the priestlyparty, whose support his grandfather, Sargon, had secured.[43] In 668B.C. the statue of Marduk was restored to its shrine, and Esarhaddon'sson, Shamash-shum-ukîn, was proclaimed King of Babylon. Esarhaddonsought to reconcile the military and aggressive party in his owncapital by crowning Ashur-bani-pal, his eldest son, as king in Assyria.But at the same time Babylon was still taught to look upon Assyria asher suzerain, and the spirit of disaffection was only driven for themoment underground. Esarhaddon's aim had been to retain the territoryalready incorporated in the Assyrian empire, and, had he been ableto confine his country's energies within these limits, its existenceas a state might have been prolonged. But he was unable to curb theambitions of his generals, and, in his effort to find employment forthe army, he achieved the ultimate object of his father's westerncampaigns, the conquest of Egypt.It was soon apparent that Esarhaddon's occupation of that country hadbeen merely nominal, and it thus fell to his son Ashur-bani-pal tocontinue the Egyptian war, and to complete the work his father had leftunfinished. And though he met with far greater success, he too in theend found the task of any permanent conquest beyond his power.[44] Forhe soon had his hands full with troubles nearer home, in consequence ofwhich his hold on Egypt gradually relaxed. Urtaku of Elam, who invadedBabylonia, does not appear to have followed up his success; and thesubsequent invasion of the country by Teumman was only followed bythat ruler's defeat and death in battle. But the strength of Elam wasnot broken by this reverse, and, when Shamash-shum-ukîn revolted, hereceived active Elamite support.Not only in Elam, but also throughout the territory controlled byAssyria, Shamash-shum-ukîn found support in his rebellion, a factsignificant of the detestation of Assyrian rule in the scatteredprovinces of the empire, which continued to be held together only byfear. But the force at Ashur-bani-pal's disposal was still powerfulenough to stamp out the conflagration and head off disaster for a time.He marched into Babylonia, besieged and captured Babylon, and hisbrother Shamash-shum-ukîn met his death in the flames of his palacein 648 B.C. The Assyrian king then invaded Elam, and, capturing itscities as he advanced, he laid the country under fire and sword. Susawas protected by its river, then in flood, but the Assyrian armyeffected a crossing, and the ancient capital lay at the mercy of theinvaders. Having taken the city, Ashur-bani-pal determined to break itspower for ever, after the manner Sennacherib had dealt with Babylon.He not only stripped the temples and carried off the treasures of thepalace, but he even desecrated the royal tombs, and completed hiswork of destruction by fire. So Susa was plundered and destroyed, andin Babylon itself Ashur-bani-pal continued to be supreme until hisdeath.[45][Illustration: ASSUR-BANIPAL AS THE RESTORER OF E-SAGILA, THE TEMPLE OFMARDUK AT BABYLON. Brit. Mus., No. 90864.]Babylonia had proved herself no match for the legions of Assyria at theheight of the hitter's power; but the industrial and commercial life ofher cities, based ultimately on the rich return her soil yielded to heragricultural population, enabled her to survive blows which would havepermanently disabled a country less favoured by nature. Moreover, shealways regarded the Assyrians as an upstart people, who had borrowedher culture, and whose land had been a mere province of her kingdomat a time when her own political influence had extended from Elam tothe borders of Syria. Even in her darkest hour she was buoyed up bythe hope of recovering her ancient glory, and she let no opportunityslip of striking a blow at the northern kingdom. She was consequentlyalways a drag on Assyria's advance to the Mediterranean, for, when thelatter's armies marched westward, they left Babylon and Elam in theirrear.In her later dealings with Babylon Assyria had tried the alternativepolicies of intimidation and in-dulgence, but with equal want ofsuccess; and they reached their climax in the reigns of Sennacheriband Esarhaddon. It is quite possible that either of these policies,if consistently pursued, would have been equally futile in its aim ofcoercing or placating Babylonia. But their alternation was a far worseblunder, as it only succeeded in revealing to the Babylonians theirown power, and in confirming them in their obstinate resistance. Tothis cause we may trace the long revolt under Shamash-shum-ukîn, whenBabylon with Elam at her back struck a succession of blows which helpedin a material degree to reduce the power of the Assyrian army, alreadyweakened by the Egyptian campaigns. And in 625 B.C., when the Scythianshad overrun the Assyrian empire, and her power was on the wane, wefind Nabopolassar proclaiming himself king in Babylon and founding anew empire which for nearly seventy years was to survive the city ofNineveh itself.[Footnote 1: Cf.

But it tookher more than a generation to realize to the full her newly awakenedambitions. After his declaration of independence, Nabopolassar'sinfluence did not extend far beyond the walls of Babylon and Borsippa.The other great cities, both in the north and south, continued for atime to acknowledge Assyrian supremacy. But the sons of Ashur-bani-pal,who succeeded him upon the throne, had inherited a reduced empire,whose sole support, the Assyrian army, was now largely composed ofdisheartened mercenaries. In Ashur-bani-pal's reign there had beensigns of coming change and of the appearance of new races before whomthe Assyrians were doomed to disappear. The destruction of Urartu hadremoved a vital barrier against the incursion of the nomad tribes,and with its disappearance we find new racial elements pressing intoWestern Asia, of the same Indo-European family as that of the Medes andtheir Iranian kinsfolk. These were the Scythians, who in the middle ofthe seventh century had driven the Cimmerians before them into AsiaMinor, and it was they who a generation later struck the death-blow ofthe Assyrian empire, pouring across it in resistless hordes. Assyriahad no force in reserve with which to oppose their progress or repairtheir ravages.For centuries this great military power had struck terror throughoutWestern Asia; but insatiable lust for dominion now met with its duereward. Since Sennacherib's day the ranks of the army had been filledwith levies drawn from her subject peoples or with mercenary troops,and these were a poor substitute for the race of hardy fighters whohad been sacrificed in their country's countless wars. So when theMedes invested Nineveh, with the possible assistance of the Scythians,and the passive encouragement of Babylon, the capital could look forno assistance from her provinces. According to Herodotus[1] the Medeshad already twice invaded Assyria before the final investment; and itwas natural that Nabopolassar should have regarded them as his allies,and have concluded a definite alliance with them by marrying hisson Nebuchadnezzar to the daughter of Cyaxares, the Median king.[2]Sennacherib's mighty walls kept the enemy at bay for three years, butin 606 B.C. the city was taken by storm, and later ages preserved thetradition that Sin-shar-ishkun, the Sarakos of the Greeks, perished inthe flames of his palace, rather than fall alive into the besiegers'hands.Though he does not appear to have taken any active part in the longsiege of Nineveh, Nabopolassar was not slow in securing his share ofthe dismembered empire. The northern territory of Assyria, includingNorthern Mesopotamia,[3] fell to the Medes, while the southerndistricts became parts of Nabopolassar's empire under a possible Mediansuzerainty.[4] But Babylon was soon to put her newly organized armyto the test. Two years before the fall of Nineveh Egypt had seizedthe opportunity, afforded her by Assyria's impotence, of occupyingPalestine and Syria.[5] She had crushed Josiah and his Hebrew army atMegiddo, and, though it is not certain whether Judah had the supportof other allies, it is clear that Necho encountered no effectiveopposition on his advance to the Euphrates. But Nabopolassar did notintend to allow this portion of the Assyrian empire to fall to Egyptunchallenged, and he despatched a Babylonian force north-westwardsalong the Euphrates under the command of the crown-prince,Nebuchadnezzar. The two armies met at Carchemish in 604 B.C., where theEgyptians were utterly routed and driven back through Palestine.[6]But Nebuchadnezzar did not press his pursuit beyond the borders ofEgypt, for news reached him at Pelusium of Nabopolassar's death, and hewas obliged to return at once to Babylon in order to carry out at thecapital the necessary ceremonies attending his accession to the throne.In spite of his withdrawal from the country, the greater part of Syriaand Palestine lost no time in transferring their allegiance to Babylon.The little state of Judah was an exception, for, though she paid hertribute at first, she soon put the warnings of the prophet Jeremiah atdefiance, and her short-sighted revolt led to the capture of Jerusalemby Nebuchadnezzar in 596 B.C., and to the carrying away of a largeportion of her population into captivity. A few years later Egypt madeher last attempt to reoccupy Palestine and Syria, and Judah joined thePhoenician cities of Sidon and Tyre in rallying to her support. In587 Nebuchadnezzar advanced into Northern Syria and took up a strongstrategic position at Riblah on the Orontes, whence he despatcheda part of his army to besiege Jerusalem. An attempt by Apries, theEgyptian king, to relieve the city was unsuccessful, and in 586Jerusalem was once more taken and the greater part of the remnant ofthe Jews followed their fellow-countrymen into exile.[7] The Babylonianarmy then occupied Phoenicia, though the city of Tyre offered anobstinate resistance and only acknowledged its allegiance to Babylonafter a long siege, which is said to have lasted for thirteen years.[8]Thus Nebuchadnezzar completed the work begun by his father,Nabopolassar, and, by the skilful and vigorous prosecution of hiscampaigns, established the Neo-Babylonian empire on a firm basis,so that its authority was unquestioned from the Persian Gulf tothe Egyptian frontier. Of his later campaigns nothing has yet beenpublished, beyond a fragmentary reference to a conflict with Amasis ofEgypt in the thirty-seventh year of his reign.[9] Though we do not knowthe circumstances under which it took place, we may assume that theBabylonian army was again victorious against the Egyptian troops andthe Greek mercenaries who fought in their ranks. A tradition is indeedpreserved by Josephus that Nebuchadnezzar made Egypt a Babylonianprovince, and although this is certainly an exaggeration, the evidencesuggests that he may well have conducted at least one successfulcampaign on Egyptian territory. The troubles of Apries in consequenceof his ill-advised expedition against Cyrene, followed by the revolt ofAmasis and his own deposition and death, may well have furnished theoccasion for a successful invasion of the country by Nebuchadnezzar.A very large number of inscriptions have been recovered of theNeo-Babylonian kings, but, unlike the foundation-records of Assyria,they contain no accounts of military expeditions, but confinethemselves to commemorating the restoration or erection of temples andpalaces in Babylon and the other great cities in the land. Consideringhis military successes, this is surprising in Nebuchadnezzar's case,and the suggestion has been made that he may have told us so little ofhis expeditions and battles because they were perhaps undertaken at thebidding of Media as his suzerain.[10] Cyaxares was his kinsman, and thepart played by Babylon in the conflict of Media with Lydia may well beexplained on that hypothesis.[Illustration: BRONZE DOOR-STEP FROM E-ZIDA, INSCRIBED WITH THE NAMEAND TITLES OF NEBUCHADNEZAR ii. Brit. Mus., No. 90851.]With the passing of Assyrian power the political importance ofLydia had risen considerably, and under Sadyattes and Alyattes,the successors of Ardys upon the Lydian throne, the ravages of theCimmerian invasion were repaired. These monarchs had conducted a longseries of attacks upon the cities and states of Ionia, and, though theywere in the main successful, they used up the resources of the nationwithout obtaining material advantages in return. Handicapped to thisextent, Lydia entered upon a five years' struggle with the growingpower of Cyaxares, who pushed back her eastern frontier. Matters cameto a head in 585 B.C., when the great battle was fought on the Halysbetween Cyaxares and Alyattes on May 28th. The battle is famous for thetotal eclipse of the sun, which took place on that day, and is said tohave been foretold by the Greek astronomer Thales of Miletus.[11] Bythe subsequent treaty the Halys was fixed as the frontier between Lydiaand the Median empire, and, according to Herodotus, it was arrangedin part through the mediation of Nebuchadnezzar.[12] The interventionof Babylon must have been undertaken in the Median interest, and itis possible that Cyaxares could count on Nebuchadnezzar for more thanbenevolent neutrality in case of need.Nebuchadnezzar appears in his inscriptions as a mighty builder, and wehave already seen how he transformed the city of Babylon. He entirelyrebuilt and enlarged his father's royal palace,[13] and in the courseof his reconstructions raised its terraced platform to so great aheight above the surrounding city and plain, that its Hanging Gardenbecame one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.[14] He rebuiltthe great temples of E-zida at Borsippa and of E-sagila at Babylon, andthe Sacred Procession-street within the city he sumptuously paved,spanning it between the temple of Ninmakh and his own palace withthe famous Ishtar Gate, adorned with bulls and dragons in enamelledrelief.[15] The fortifications of the city he also greatly strengthenedby the extension of its double line of walls and the erection of newcitadels.[16] During his long reign of forty-two years he devoted hisenergies and the new wealth of his kingdom to this work of rebuilding,both in the capital and in the other ancient religious centres ofBabylonia.[17] The decoration of the façade of Nebuchadnezzar's ownpalace reflects the influence of the West upon Babylonian art; and wemay picture her markets and quays as thronged with foreign caravansand merchandise. Evidence of her extended horizon at this period mayalso be traced in the interest which Nebuchadnezzar showed in thesea-traffic on the Persian Gulf, which doubtless led him to constructa harbour in the swamps, and to protect it against Arab raids by theerection of the town of Teredon to the west of the Euphrates, as anoutpost on the desert frontier.[18]Nebuchadnezzar's son, Amêl-Marduk, was an unworthy successor to hisfather. During his short reign he was restrained neither by law nordecency,[19] and it is not surprising that in less than three yearsthe priestly party should have secured his assassination and haveset Neriglissar, his brother-in-law, in his place, a man of farstronger character and a soldier.[20] The son of a private Babylonian,Bêl-shum-ishkun, Neriglissar had married a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar,and we may certainly identify him with Nergal-sharezer, the Rab-magor Babylonian general who was present at the siege of Jerusalem.[21]A striking proof that Neriglissar enjoyed high military rank inNebuchadnezzar's reign has recently been obtained in a letter fromErech, which was written by a captain in charge of a body of troopsstationed in the neighbourhood of that city.[22] The date of theletter is certain, since the captain refers to soldiers on the rollof Nebuchadnezzar and Neriglissar; and incidentally it gives us aglimpse of the unsatisfactory condition of the Babylonian army duringNebuchadnezzar's closing years. The captain is anxious that thedepleted state of his company, and the measures he contemplates inorder to fill its ranks, should not be known to Gubaru, who exerciseda high command in Nebuchadnezzar's army. It is possible that we mayidentify this general with the governor of Gutium, who played soprominent a part in the Persian conquest. Knowing, as he doubtlessdid, the unsatisfactory condition of his country's forces, he mayperhaps have regarded the task of opposing the invaders as quite beyondtheir powers.[23] Neriglissar's death, less than four years afterhis accession, must certainly have been the death-blow to any hopeshis generals may have entertained of placing the country's militaryorganization and defence upon a sound footing. For his son was littlemore than a child, and after nine months' reign the priestly partyat the capital succeeded in deposing him in favour of one of theirown number, Nabonidus, a man of priestly descent[24] and thoroughlyimbued with the traditions of the hierarchy. The new king carried onNebuchadnezzar's tradition of temple-reconstruction with enthusiasm,but he had none of his great predecessor's military aptitude. Tohis own priestly detachment he added the unpractical character ofthe archæologist, loving to occupy himself in investigating thepast history of the temples he rebuilt, in place of controlling hiscountry's administration. The bent of his mind is well reflectedin the account he has left us of the dedication of his daughter,Bêl-shalti-Nannar, as head of the college of votaries attached to theMoon-temple at Ur.[25] It is clear that this act and the accompanyingceremonial interested him far more than the education of his son; andany military aptitude Belshazzar may have developed was certainly notfostered by his father or his father's friends. It was only when theenemy was at the frontier that the king must have realized his ownfatuity.Thus with the accession of Nabonidus the close of Babylon's last periodof greatness is in sight. But the empire did not crumble of its ownaccord, for in one of his foundation-records the king boasts that thewhole of Mesopotamia and the West, as far as Gaza on the Egyptianborder, continued to acknowledge his authority.[26] It requiredpressure from without to shatter the decaying empire, which from thefirst must have owed its success in no small measure to the friendlyand protective attitude of Media. When that essential support was nolonger forthcoming, it lay at the mercy of the new power before whichMedia herself had already gone down.The Persian kingdom of Cyrus, rising on a new wave of the Indo-Europeanmigration, had had little difficulty in absorbing that of theMedes.[27] Five years after the accession of Nabonidus, Cyrus haddeposed Astyages, and, uniting his own followers from the south ofIran with their Median kinsfolk, he proceeded to deal with Croesus ofLydia. Under her last king, the successor of Alyattes, the power ofLydia had risen to its greatest height, and the fame of Croesus' wealthhad attracted many of the more cultured Greeks to his court at Sardis.But when Cyrus made himself master of the Median empire, Croesus beganto fear his growing power. In 547 B.C. he fought an indecisive battlewith the Persians at Pteria in Cappadocia, near the site of the oldHittite capital, and he then retreated on Sardis. Here he sent forassistance to Sparta, Egypt and Babylon. But Cyrus did not delay beforerenewing his attack, and he appeared unexpectedly before the capital.The Lydian army was now signally defeated; Sardis, in which Croesus hadtaken refuge, was captured after a siege, and the Lydian empire broughtto an end. Cyrus was then free to turn his attention to Babylon.[Illustration: I. BAKED CLAY FOUNDATION CYLINDER OF NABONIDUS,REFERRING TO THE DEFEAT OF ASTYAGES BY CYRUS (Brit. Mus., No. 91109.)II. BAKED CLAY FOUNDATION CYLINDER OF CYRUS RECORDING HIS ENTRY INTOBABYLON WITHOUT BATTLE AND WITHOUT FIGHTING. (Brit. Mus., No 90920.)]If we should be right in identifying Gobryas or Gubaru, the governorof Gutium, with the Babylonian general of that name, who had held highposition under Nebuchadnezzar,[28] we may trace the speed and ease ofthe Persian conquest of Babylonia directly to his action in espousingthe cause of the invader. Foreseeing that the only hope for his countrylay in its speedy submission, he may have considered that he would beacting in its best interests if he did not oppose its incorporationwithin the Persian empire, but rendered the revolution so far aspossible a peaceful one. That would explain the action of Cyrus inentrusting the invasion largely to his hands; and the subsequent revoltof Sippar is the more easily accounted for if a Babylonian general withGubaru's reputation had appeared as the envoy of the Persian king. Inany case we must assume that a large section of the Akkadian populationwas of that way of thinking, quite apart from the opposition to himselfthat Nabonidus had aroused in the priestly party of the capital.The defence of the country was entrusted by Nabonidus to his sonBelshazzar, who met the advancing Persians at Opis, where he wasdefeated; and, as often as he attempted to rally his forces, they wereagain dispersed.[29] Sippar then opened its gates without fighting,Nabonidus fled, and Gubaru advancing on the capital secured itspeaceful surrender. The native chronicler of these events recordsthat, during the early days of the Persian occupation of the city, theshields of Gutium surrounded the doors of E-sagila, so that no man'sspear entered the sacred shrines and no military standard was broughtin.[30] The record gains fresh meaning if we may assume that thegovernor of Gutium was himself of native origin and a former generalof the Babylonian army. On the third day of the following month Cyrusmade his state entry into the capital, being received by all classes,and especially by the priesthood and the nobles, as a liberator. Heappointed Gubaru his governor of Babylon, and the latter appears tohave stamped out further resistance by pursuing Belshazzar and puttinghim to death.[31] Nabonidus had already been taken, when the capitalsurrendered.It is perhaps remarkable that the native priesthood, from whose ranksNabonidus himself had sprung, should have welcomed the Persian kingas their country's deliverer, whose victory had been brought about byMarduk, the national god. But, after securing the secular control,Nabonidus had given free rein to his priestly ambition, and, as aconsequence, had estranged his own party. His imagination may havebeen fired by some ill-advised scheme of centralizing worship; but,whatever his motive, the king had collected many of the cult-imagesthroughout the country into the capital, little recking that he therebytore the gods from their ancient habitations. By restoring the gods totheir local shrines, Cyrus gained in popularity, and completely wonover the priesthood, by far the most powerful political section of thecommunity.[32] Thus it happened that Babylon made no further struggleto retain her freedom, and the whole of the territory she had enjoyedwas incorporated without resistance in the Persian empire.With the permanent loss of Babylon's independence, the period coveredby this history draws to an end. The epoch forms a convenientstopping-place; but, unlike the fall of the Assyrian empire, herconquest made but little difference to the life and activities of thepopulation as a whole. It may therefore be permissible to glance aheada little, and note her subsequent fortunes as a subject province, underthe foreign domination of the powers which succeeded one another in therule of that region of Western Asia. The tranquillity of the countryunder Cyrus formed a striking contrast to the unrest and intrigue whichcharacterized its attitude under Assyrian rule; and this was due to thefact that the policy he inaugurated in the provinces of his empire wasa complete reversal of Assyrian methods. For the nationality of eachconquered race was respected, and it was encouraged to retain its ownreligion and its laws and customs. Hence Babylon's commercial life andprosperity suffered no interruption in consequence of the change in herpolitical status. Taxation was not materially increased, and little wasaltered beyond the name and title of the reigning king in the datesupon commercial and legal documents.[33]This state of things would doubtless have continued, had not theauthority of the Persian empire itself been rudely shaken during thereign of Cambyses, Cyrus' son and successor. The conquest of Egypt andits incorporation as an integral part of the Achæmenian empire, towhich he directed his main energies, were achieved after the battle ofPelusium and the fall of Memphis. But when attempting to extend hissway over Nubia in the south, he received news of revolt in Persia.Before his departure for Egypt he had murdered his brother Bardiya,known to the Greeks as Smerdis. The murder had been kept a secret,and the revolt against the absent king was now headed by a Magian,named Gaumata, who gave himself out as the missing Smerdis and thetrue heir to the throne.[34] Cambyses made preparations to repressthe revolt, but died on his return journey in Syria in 522. The deathof the king gave a fresh impetus to the forces of rebellion, whichnow began to spread through the provinces of the Persian empire. ButGaumata, the Persian rebel, soon met his fate. For after Cambyses'death, the Persian army was led back by Darius, a prince of the samehouse as Cyrus and his son; Gaumata was surprised and murdered, andDarius firmly established on the throne. Darius continued to act withextraordinary energy, and in the course of a single year succeeded inquelling the rebellions in Babylon and in the various provinces.[35]On the rock-face of Behistun in Persia, on the road from Babylon toEcbatana, he has left us sculptured portraits of himself and the rebelleaders he subdued. The latter include Nidintu-Bêl and Arakha, the twopretenders to the Babylonian throne.[36]The sieges of Babylon by Darius mark the beginning of the city's decay.Her defences had not been seriously impaired by Cyrus, but they nowsuffered considerably. The city was again restless during Darius'closing years,[37] and further damage was done to it in the reign ofXerxes, when the Babylonians made their last bids for independence.[38]For Xerxes is said not only to have dismantled the walls, but to haveplundered and destroyed the great temple of Marduk itself. Large areasin the city, which had been a wonder of the nations, now began to liepermanently in ruins. Babylon entered on a new phase in 331 B.C.,when the long struggle between Greece and Persia was ended by thedefeat of Darius III. at Gaugamela. For Susa and Babylon submitted toAlexander, who on proclaiming himself King of Asia, took Babylon ashis capital. We may picture him gazing on the city's great buildings,many of which now lay ruined and deserted. Like Cyrus before him, hesacrificed to Babylon's gods; and he is said to have wished to restoreE-sagila, Marduk's great temple, but to have given up the idea, as itwould have taken ten thousand men more than two months to remove therubbish from the ruins. But he seems to have made some attempt in thatdirection, since a tablet has been found, dated in his sixth year,which records a payment of ten manehs of silver for "clearing away thedust of E-sagila."[39][Illustration: IMPRESSIONS OF NEO-BABYLONIAN AND PERSIAN CYLINDERSEALS.

Mus., Nos. 18249, 89146, 89352.]While the old buildings decayed, some new ones arose in their place,including a Greek theatre for the use of the large Greek colony.[40]Many of the Babylonians themselves adopted Greek names and fashions,but the more conservative elements, particularly among the priesthood,continued to retain their own separate life and customs. In the year270 B.C. we have a record that Antiochus Soter restored the temples ofNairn and Marduk at Babylon and Borsippa,[41] and the recent diggingsat Erech have shown that the old temple in that city retained itsancient cult under a new name.[42] In the second century we know that,in a corner of the great temple at Babylon, Marduk and the God ofHeaven were worshipped as a two-fold deity under the name of Anna-Bêl;and we hear of priests attached to one of Babylon's old shrines aslate as the year 29 B.C. Services in honour of the later forms of theBabylonian gods were probably continued into the Christian era.The life of the ancient city naturally flickered longest aroundthe ruined temples and seats of worship. On the secular side, as acommercial centre, she was then but a ghost of her former self. Herreal decay had set in when Seleucus, after securing the satrapy ofBabylon on Alexander's death, had recognized the greater advantagesoffered by the Tigris for maritime communication. On the foundation ofSeleucia, Babylon as a city began rapidly to decay. Deserted at firstby the official classes, followed later by the merchants, she decreasedin importance as her rival grew. Thus it was by a gradual and purelyeconomic process, and through no sudden blow, that Babylon slowly bledto death.[Footnote 1: I., 102 f.][Footnote 2: According to Abydenus in Eusebius, "Chron., lib.

It records the rebuilding of Bît-rêsh bya certain Anu-uballit, the second prefect (_shanû_) of Erech, who alsobore the Greek name Νίαρκος _Nikiḳarḳusu, Nikarḳusu_; it was clearlya privilege to bear a Greek name, as he tells us he was given his by"Antiochus, king of the lands." The text furnishes additional evidenceof the survival of the literary language of Babylon for officialrecords, and of the conservatism of the religious cult.]CHAPTER XGREECE, PALESTINE AND BABYLON: AN ESTIMATE OF CULTURAL INFLUENCEDuring the Persian and Hellenistic periods Babylon exerted an influenceupon contemporary races of which we may trace some survivals in thecivilization of the modern world. She was the mother of astronomy,and the twelve divisions on the dial of our clocks and watches wereultimately derived, through Greek channels, from her ancient system oftime-division. It was under the Neo-Babylonian kings that the Hebrewrace first came into close contact with her culture, and there can beno doubt that the Jews, in the time of their captivity, renewed theirinterest in her mythology when they found it presented some parallelsto their own. But in the course of this history it has been shown that,during far earlier periods, the civilization of Babylon had penetratedthroughout a great part of Western Asia. It is admitted that, as aresult of her westward expansion at the time of the First Dynasty,her culture had spread during subsequent periods to the Mediterraneancoast-lands, and had moulded to some extent the development of thosepeoples with whom it came in contact. And since the religious elementdominated her own activities in a greater measure than was the casewith most other races of antiquity, it has been urged that manyfeatures in Hebrew religion and in Greek mythology can only be rightlyexplained by Babylonian beliefs in which they had their origin. It isthe purpose of this chapter to examine a theory of Babylon's externalinfluence, which has been propagated by a school of writers and hasdetermined the direction of much recent research.It is scarcely necessary to insist on the manner in which materialdrawn from Babylonian and Assyrian sources has helped to elucidatepoints in the political and religious history of Israel. Scarcelyless striking, though not so numerous, are the echoes from Babylonianlegends which have long been recognized as existing in Greek mythology.The best known example of direct borrowing is undoubtedly the myth ofAdonis and Aphrodite, the main features of which correspond closelyto the Babylonian legend of Tammuz and Ishtar. In this case not onlythe myth, but the accompanying festival and rites were also borrowed,passing to Greece by way of Byblos on the Syrian coast and Paphos inCyprus, both centres of Astarte worship.[1] Another Greek legend,obviously of Babylonian origin, is that of Actseon, who is clearly tobe identified with the shepherd, loved by Ishtar and changed by herinto a leopard, so that he was hunted and killed by his own hounds.[2]Some parallels have also long been pointed out between the nationalheroes Heracles and Gilgamesh. It is true that most races of antiquitypossess stories of national heroes of superhuman strength and power,but there are certain features in the traditions concerning Heracleswhich may have some ultimate connexion with the Gilgamesh cycle oflegends.[3] Less convincing is the analogy which has been suggestedbetween Icarus and Etana, the Babylonian hero or demi-god, whosucceeded in flying to the highest heaven only to fall headlong to theearth. For in Etana's case there is no question of human flight: hewas carried to heaven by his friend the Eagle, to whose wings he clungwhile they mounted to heaven's gates. But the examples already referredto may suffice to illustrate the way in which it has long been agreedthat Babylonian mythology may have left its impress on that of Greece.But the views now held by a considerable body of scholars suggest amuch broader extension of Babylonian influence than is implied by aseries of isolated and fortuitous connexions; and, as the character ofthis influence is _ex hypothesi_ astronomical, any attempt to defineits limits with precision is a matter of some difficulty. For it willbe obvious that, if we may assume an astronomical basis or backgroundto any two mythologies, we at once detect a great number of commonfeatures the existence of which we should not otherwise have suspected.And the reason is not far to seek; for the astronomical phenomena withwhich we go to work are necessarily restricted in number, and theyhave to do duty many times over as a background in each system.[4] Inspite of this disadvantage, which is inherent in their theory, Wincklerand his school have rendered good service in working out the generalrelationship which was believed by the Babylonians to exist betweenthe heavenly bodies and the earth.[5] He has shown sound reasons forassuming that, according to the tenets of Babylonian astrology, eventsand institutions on earth were in a certain sense copies of heavenlyprototypes.It is well known that the Babylonians, like the Hebrews, conceived theuniverse as consisting of three parts: the heaven above, the earthbeneath, and the waters under the earth. The Babylonians graduallyelaborated this conception of the universe, and traced in the heavensa parallel to the threefold division of earth, separating the universeinto a heavenly and an earthly world. The earthly universe consisted asbefore of three divisions, that is to say the heaven (limited to theair or atmosphere above the earth), the earth itself, and the watersbeneath it. Those corresponded in the heavenly world to the Northernheaven, the Zodiac, and the Southern heaven or heavenly ocean. By thelater Babylonian period the greater gods had long become identifiedwith the planets, and the lesser gods with the fixed stars, each deityhaving his special house or star in heaven in addition to his templeon earth. This idea appears to have been carried still further bythe later Greek astrologers, by whom lands and cities in addition totemples were thought to have their cosmic counterparts.[6] But even forthe Babylonians the moving stars were not merely symbols serving asinterpreters to men of the divine will; their movements were the actualcause of events on earth. To use an apposite simile of Winckler, heavenwas believed to be related to earth much as a moving object seen in amirror was related to its reflection.[7][Illustration: LIMESTONE STATUE OF THE GOD NABÛ AT NIMRÛD.]In order to illustrate the way in which these astral ideas are saidto have supplied material to Greek mythology, a test instance maybe selected, the suggested explanation of which involves one of theessential features of Winckler's astral system as he eventuallyelaborated it.[8] We will take the story of the Golden Lamb ofAtreus and Thyestes, which is introduced by Euripides into one of thechoruses in his _Electra_[9] According to the story, which is referredto, but not explicitly told, by Euripides, the Lamb with the GoldenFleece was brought by Pan to Atreus, and was regarded by the Argivesas a sign that he was the true king. But his brother Thyestes, withthe help of Atreus' wife, stole it and claimed to be king; so strifeensued, good was turned to evil, and the stars were shaken in theircourses. It is curious that the theft of the Lamb should have such aspecial effect upon the heavens and the weather, for this is definitelystated in the second strophe and antistrophe of the chorus.[10] Thoughdetails are obscure, it is clear that we here have a legend withstrongly marked astrological elements. The theft of the Lamb changesthe sun's course, and from other lines in the chorus we gather that thealteration led to the present climatic conditions of the world, therain-clouds flying northward and leaving "the seats of Amnion"--thatis, the Libyan desert--parched and dewless.In its original form the legend may well have been a story of the FirstSin, after which the world was changed to its present state, both moraland atmospheric.[11] There is definite evidence that the Golden Lambwas identified with the constellation Aries; and since Babylon wasadmittedly the home of astrology, it is not an improbable suggestion,in spite of the reference to Ammon, that we should regard it as oneof the lost legends of Babylon. According to Winckler's theory of theBabylonian religion, we should go further, and trace the origin of thelegend to a convulsion in Babylonian thought which took place in theninth and eighth centuries B.C. At this period, it is asserted, the sunat the vernal equinox was moving from the constellation Taurus intoAries, The bull, according to the theory, was identified with Marduk,the god of Babylon,[12] and all the time he was yielding his placeto the Ram, Babylon was declining before the power of Assyria. Thedisorganization of the calendar and the seasons, due to the imperfectmethod of time-reckoning in vogue, was associated with this event,giving an impetus to a fresh birth of legends, one of which has foundits way in a Greek dress into this chorus of Euripides. Or, as ithas been put rather differently, the story is a piece of Babylonianastronomy misunderstood.The theory underlying this interpretation of the legend is based onthe axiom that the Babylonian religion was essentially a star-worship,and that behind every department of the national literature, secularas well as religious, lay the same astral conception of the universe.Before treating the theory in greater detail, it may be well toascertain how far the history of the country substantiates this view.In the earliest period of which we have recovered material remainsthere can be no doubt that image-worship formed a characteristicfeature of the Babylonian religious system, though we have no means oftracing its gradual evolution out of the fetish and stock-and-stoneworship which necessarily preceded it.[13] The extraneous civilization,which the Sumerians introduced, most probably included cult-imagesof their gods, and these may well have been already anthropomorphic.Fashioned in the god's form, the image was believed to enshrine hispresence, and for the Babylonians of all periods it never lost thisanimistic character.[Illustration: FIG. 66. FIG. 67. FIG. 68.THE WEATHER-GOD AND TWO GODDESSES FROM AN ASSYRIAN BAS-RELIEF.The goddesses wear the homed headdresses of Babylonian deities, and, asthey are represented being carried by soldiers, they had probably beentaken from a captured Babylonian town.(After Layard.)]A tribal or city-god, in his earliest stage of development, wasdoubtless wholly identified with his cult-image. No more than oneimage of each was worshipped, and the idea of a god's existence apartfrom this visible form must have been of gradual growth.[14] Themisfortunes of the material image, especially if unaccompanied bynational disaster, would have fostered a belief in the god's existenceapart from his visible body of wood or stone. And such a beliefeventually developed into the Babylonian conception of a heavenlydivision of the universe, in which the great gods had their dwelling,making their presence manifest to men in the stars and planets thatmoved across the sky. But this development marked a great advance uponpure image-worship, and undoubtedly followed the growth of a pantheonout of a collection of separate and detached city-gods. We have nomeans of dating the association of some of the greater gods withnatural forces. It would seem that, in the earlier Sumerian period,religious centres in the country were already associated with lunarand solar cults and with other divisions of nature-worship. But it isquite certain that, during all subsequent stages of Babylonian history,the divine image never degenerated into a mere symbol of divinity.Without consciously postulating a theory in explanation of his belief,the Babylonian found no difficulty in reconciling a localization of thedivine person with his presence at other cult centres and ultimatelywith a separate life in the heavenly sphere.[Illustration: FIG. 69. FIGURE OF DEITY IN SHRINE.(After Layard.)]That this was actually the case is proved by a number of historicalexamples. With the rise of Babylon we may note the important part whichthe actual image of Marduk played in each coronation ceremony and inthe renewal of the king's oath at every subsequent Feast of the NewYear; the hands of no other image than that in E-sagila would servefor the king to grasp. In Hammurabi's reign we see the Babylonian'sconception of his visible gods reflected in his treatment of foreignimages.[15] The international exchange of deities in the fourteenthand thirteenth centuries has already been referred to,[16] and therecovery of captured images was always recorded with enthusiasm.[17]For the images themselves constituted a nation's chief weapon ofoffence, and there was always the chance that, if properly treated bytheir captors, they might transfer their influence to the other side.This close connexion between the god and his image survived into theNeo-Babylonian period, and Nabonidus' offence in the eyes of thepriesthood was simply that he ignored the feeling. Historical evidencethus suggests that the astral aspect of divinity in Babylonia was notan original feature of its religious system, and that it was neveradopted to the exclusion of more primitive ideas.[Illustration: DIVINE EMBLEMS ON A CHARTER OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR I. Brit.Mus., No. 90838.]A similar result follows if we examine the relation of a Babyloniandeity to his sculptured emblem, by means of which his authority orpresence could in certain circumstances be secured or indicated. Theorigin of such emblems was not astrological, nor is it to be soughtin liver-augury: they were not derived from fancied resemblances toanimals or objects, presented either by constellations in heaven, or bymarkings on the liver of a victim. It is clear that they arose in thefirst instance from the characters or attributes assumed by the godsin the mythology; their transference to constellations was a secondaryprocess, and their detection in liver-markings resulted, not in theirown origin but in that of the omen.[18] In the earliest period theemblem of a city-god might symbolize his city's power,[19] and thoseof other deities expressed some quality in the character of theirpossessor, or were drawn from a weapon, object or animal with whichthey were associated in tradition.[20]Another class of images were the animal forms, also drawn largely fromthe mythology, which adorned the earlier temples and were reproducedin enamelled brickwork on secular buildings by the Neo-Babyloniankings. Most of these, in the later as in the earlier periods, wereplaced near temple-entrances, and where stone was so plentiful thatit could be used in bulk in the structure of buildings, the doorwaysthemselves were carved in the same way. That animal forms wereemployed to symbolize sound is suggested by the representation of agreat harp or lyre on a Sumerian-bas-relief, in which the figure of abull surmounting the sound-case is evidently intended to suggest thepeculiarly deep and vibrant tones of the instrument.[21] Moreover, oncylinder-seals engraved with the figure of the Sun-god emerging fromthe Eastern Gate of heaven, two lions are often set immediately abovethe opening doors, and in one specimen the gate-pivots rest upon asecond pair arranged symmetrically below them.[22][Illustration: FIG. 70.SUMERIAN HARP.(After _Déc. en Chald.,_ pl. 23.)]The symbolism of these and similar monsters may well have beensuggested by the grinding of the heavy doors in their stone sockets andthe shrieking of thair bolts.[23] The noises suggested the cries ofanimals, which, in accordance with the tenets of primitive animism,were thought to inhabit the doors and gateways and to guard them. Wemay probably trace to this ancestry the colossal lions and wingedbulls which flanked the doorways of Assyrian and Persian palaces, and,like the enamelled monsters of Babylon and Persepolis, continued tobe reproduced as divine guardians of a building after their primitiveassociations had been forgotten or modified.[24][Illustration: FIG. 71.THE GUARDIAN LIONS OF THE EASTERN GATE OF HEAVEN.(After Heuzey.)]Archæological evidence thus supports the view, already deduced fromhistorical considerations, that astrology did not dominate thereligious activities of Babylon. And an examination of the literaturepoints to the same conclusion. Magic and divination bulk largely inthe texts recovered, and in their case there is nothing to suggestan underlying astrological element.[25] We are the less inclined,therefore, to accept the axiom that an astral conception of theuniverse permeated and coloured Babylonian thought to such an extent,that not only myths and legends, but even historical events, wererecorded in terms which reflect the movements of the sun, moon andplanets and the other phenomena of the heavens. If we once grant thisassumption, it might perhaps have followed, as the astral mythologistsclaim, that the beliefs of the Babylonian star-worshippers became theprevailing doctrine of the ancient East and left their traces broadcastupon the records of antiquity. But the original assumption appearsto be unsound, and the theory can only find support by treating lateevidence as applicable to all stages of Babylonian history.[Illustration: FIG. 72.WINGED MONSTER ON ENAMELLED FRIEZE AT PERSEPOLIS.(After Dieulafoy.)]The roots of the theory are placed in a purely imaginary age, whereevidence for or against it is lacking. Thus the oldest monumentswhich have been recovered upon Babylonian sites are not consideredrelics of the early stages of Babylonian culture.[26] It is assertedthat in the periods behind them there existed an elaborate andhighly developed civilization, lying back in the darkness beyond theearliest extant records. In the total absence of material evidence,it is no difficult task to paint this age in colours which are sharedby no other early or primitive race in the world's history. It isassumed that war and violence had no existence in Babylonia in thisprehistoric time. Intellect dominated and controlled the passions ofthe primeval but highly gifted people, and in particular one form ofintellectual conception based on a scientific knowledge of astronomy.It is postulated that a purely astronomical theory of the universelay at the root of their civilization, and governed their wholethought and conduct. This was no teaching of a learned priesthood,but was a universally held belief which permeated every branch ofthe national and individual life. The theory in its perfect anduncorrupted state had perished with the other relics of its inventors.But it was inherited by the Semitic immigrants into Babylonia, and,though employed by them in an altered and corrupted form, has, it issaid, left its traces in the later records. In this way the astralmythologist would explain the fragmentary character of his data, fromwhich he claims to reconstruct the original beliefs in their entirety.One such belief has been preserved by Seneca,[27] who, giving Berossusas his authority, refers to a Chaldean theory of a great year, a longcosmical period having, like the year, a summer and a winter. Thesummer is marked by a great conflagration produced by the conjunctionof all the planets in Cancer, and the winter is characterized by auniversal deluge caused by a similar conjunction of all the planetsin Capricorn. The idea is evidently based on the conception that, asthe succession of day and night corresponds to the changes of theseasons, so the year itself must correspond to greater cycles of time.Though Berossus is our earliest authority, the doctrine is regardedas a primitive Babylonian one. It is further argued that, even in theearliest period, the inhabitants of Babylonia conceived the history ofthe world to have been evolved in a series of successive ages, bearingthe same relation to these aeons of the world-cycle as the year bore tothem.The theory of Ages of the World is familiar enough from the classicalconception, first met with in Hesiod's "Works and Days,"[28] whichprofoundly influenced later Greek speculation. There is nothingparticularly astral about Hesiod's conception of four ages,distinguished by the principal metals and showing progressivedeterioration. But it is claimed that Hesiod's theory, and all parallelconceptions of World-Ages, are derived from a Babylonian prototype,Hesiod's Golden Age reflecting the general condition of prehistoricBabylonia. Assuming a close correspondence between the zodiac and theearth in early Babylonian thought, it is argued that the inhabitants ofthe country from the earliest periods divided the world's history intoages of about two thousand years each, according to the particular signof the zodiac in which the sun stood each year at the vernal equinox,when the New Year's Festival was celebrated.[29] Although these agesare never named nor mentioned in the inscriptions, they are referred toby the astral mythologists as the Ages of the Twins, the Bull, and theRam,[30] from the zodiacal constellations of Gemini, Taurus, and Aries.This is a vital point of the theory and it postulates on the part ofthe early Babylonians a highly accurate knowledge of astronomy: itassumes a knowledge of the procession of the equinoxes, which couldonly be based on a very rigid system of astronomical observation andrecord.[31] But the ancient Babylonians are supposed to have been quitefamiliar with these facts, and to have traced a close connexion betweenthem and the world's history. Certain myths are supposed to havecharacterized each of these world ages, not only affecting religiousbeliefs, but so obsessing Babylonian thought that they influencedhistorical writings. As the sun at the vernal equinox graduallyprogressed through the ecliptic constellations, so, according to thetheory, the history of the world was believed to be evolved in harmonywith its course, and the pre-ordained fate of the universe was slowlyunrolled.[Illustration: TWO VIEWS OF A CLAY MODEL OF A SHEEP'S LIVER, ANNOTATEDFOR PURPOSES OF DIVINATION. Brit. Mus., No. 90668.]Up to this point the astral theory is very complete and, grantingits original hypotheses, it goes smoothly enough. But as soon as itsauthors try to fit the existing legends to their theory, difficultiesbegin. In Babylonian mythology we find no pair of heroes who presentany resemblance to the Dioscuri. But lunar cults were prominent in theearliest Babylonian epoch, and, in default of any closer parallel,the two phases of the waxing and the waning moon have been treated ascharacterizing the myths and legends of the Age of the Twins. Borrowinga term from music, they are described as the characteristic _motif_of the age. The second Age, that of the Bull, begins roughly with therise of Babylon to power. There is very slender evidence for connectingMarduk, the god of Babylon, with the zodiacal constellation of theBull, but the connexion is confidently assumed.[32] The Third Age, thatof the Ram, presents even more difficulties than its two predecessors,for no amount of ingenuity can discover material for a Ram _motif_ atBabylon. But Jupiter Amnion was represented with the head of a ram,and he is assumed to have been identical in his nature with Marduk.Thus the new reckoning is supposed to have passed over to Egypt,while Babylon remained unaffected.[33] The explanation put forward isthat the Ram Age began at a time when the power of Babylon was on thedecline; but why the Babylonians should therefore have ignored thetrue position of the sun at the vernal equinox is not quite obvious.The foreign influence of Babylon's conception of the universe is saidto have left its strongest imprint on Hebrew historical writing.It is claimed that the Biblical narratives relating to the earlierhistory of the Hebrews have in particular been influenced by theBabylonian myths of the universe, and that a great number of passageshave in consequence an astral significance. This side of the subjecthas been worked out in detail by Dr. Alfred Jeremias,[34] and a fewexamples will suffice to illustrate the system of interpretation whichis suggested. We will take one of the Babylonian legends which issaid to be most frequently encountered in the Hebrew narratives, theDescent of the goddess Ishtar into the Underworld in search of heryouthful husband Tammuz, which in its Babylonian form is unquestionablya nature-myth. There can be little doubt that in the myth Tammuzrepresents the vegetation of spring; this, after being parched up bythe summer-heat, is absent from the earth during the winter months,until restored by the goddess of fertility. There is also no doubtthat the cult of Tammuz eventually spread into Palestine, for Ezekielin a vision saw women at the north gate of the temple at Jerusalemweeping for Tammuz.[35] We have already noted its arrival in Greecein the story of Adonis and Aphrodite.[36] In its Greek form thecontest between Aphrodite and Persephone for the possession of Adonisreproduces the struggle between Ishtar and Ereshkigal in the Abode ofthe Dead; and the annual disappearance and reappearance of Tammuzgives rise in the Greek version to the decision of Zeus that Adonisshould spend one part of the year above ground with Aphrodite and theother part underground with Persephone.[37] Such are the main facts,which are not disputed, concerning this particular Babylonian myth. Wemay now note the manner in which it is said that _motifs_ from it areinterwoven in the Old Testament with traditions concerning the earlyhistory of the Hebrews.It is well known that in early Christian writings, such as the Syriac"Hymn of the Soul," a Gnostic composition of the second or thirdcentury A.D.,[38] the land of Egypt is sometimes referred to in ametaphorical or allegorical sense. It is suggested that the storyof Abraham's journey with his wife Sarah into Egypt[39] may havebeen written, by a parallel system of allegory, in terms reflectinga descent into the underworld and a rescue from it. It is true thatin the story Pharaoh's house is plagued, probably with sterility, afeature that recalls the cessation of fertility on earth while thegoddess of love remains in the underworld. But the same _motif is_traced in the rescue of Lot from Sodom: here Sodom is the underworld.The pit into which Joseph is thrown by his brethren and the prisoninto which Potiphar casts him also represent the underworld: andhis two fellow-prisoners, the chief baker and the chief butler, aretwo minor deities in Marduk's household.[40] The cave at Makkedah,in which the five kings of the Amorites hid themselves after theirdefeat by Joshua,[41] is said to have the same _motif_ underlying it.In short, any cave, or prison, or state of misery mentioned in theHebrew narratives may, according to astral interpretation, be taken asrepresenting the underworld.[42]The one other _motif_ we will take from the Babylonian mythology isthe Dragon-combat, since this illustrates the principal pattern, orsystem, on which the astral mythologist arranges his material. In theBabylonian story of the Creation it will be recalled how Tiamat, thedragon of chaos, revolted with Apsû, the god of the abyss, againstthe new and ordered ways of the gods; how Marduk, the champion of thegods, defeated her, and, cutting her body in half, used one half ofher as a firmament for the heaven, and then proceeded to carry outhis other works of creation.[43] The probability has long been notedthat the Dragon-combat may have suggested certain metaphorical phrasesor descriptions in Hebrew poetical and prophetic literature.[44] Butthe astral mythologist uses it as the dominant _motif_ of his Age ofTaurus; and, since this age began, according to his theory, before theperiod of Abraham, the Marduk myths are traced more frequently thanany others in the Old Testament. The astral god plays the part of adeliverer in the mythology: hence any Biblical hero who is recorded tohave rescued any one, or to have delivered his family or people, formsa convenient peg on which to hang a _motif_ So too the birth of thefounder of a dynasty, or of the inaugurator of a new age, is said toreflect the solar _motif_ of the birth of the spring sun.[45]In this process of detecting hidden _motifs,_ numbers play an importantpart. To take one example, they are said to indicate that David'sfight with Goliath reflects the myth of the Year-Cycle. The forty daysduring which Goliath, who is identified with the Dragon Tiamat,[46]drew near to the Israelites morning and evening are symbolical ofwinter. In the Hebrew text his height is given as six cubits and aspan;[47] the figure is emended to read five cubits and a span, sinceotherwise the number would not correspond to the five and a quarterepagomenal days.[48] With the best will in the world to be convincedone cannot help feeling that, even assuming the soundness of thetheory, its authors have let it run away with them. It cannot ofcourse be denied that astrological conceptions may colour some of thestories in the Old Testament. The three hundred foxes, with firebrandstied to their brushes, with which Samson destroyed the standing cornof the Philistines, find a striking parallel in the ceremonial whichtook place annually in the circus at Rome during the Cerealia,[49] andmay well be regarded as folk-mythology of astrological origin.[50]Elijah's chariot of fire may have been suggested by some astronomicalphenomenon, perhaps a comet; it was probably the product of the sameassociation of ideas as Medea's dragon-chariot, the gift of Helios. Butthis scarcely prepares us to accept such an allegorizing of details asis proposed in other passages.Precisely the same principles of interpretation have been applied tothe heroes of Greek legend. Professor Jensen of Marburg, in his workon the Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh, has attempted to trace almostevery figure, not only in the Old Testament, but also in classicalmythology, to a Babylonian source.[51] But his rather monotonous methodof perceiving on all sides reflexions of his own hero Gilgamesh hasalready been criticized sufficiently, and we will take some examplesfrom a more recent work by Dr. Carl Fries,[52] who has made othercontributions of a less speculative character upon Greek and Orientalconnexions. Elaborating a published suggestion of Professor Jensen, Dr.Fries has enthusiastically applied the astral method of interpretationto the Odyssey. Such an episode as the voyage of Odysseus to Hades, inorder to consult the Theban prophet Teiresias, undoubtedly presents aclose parallel to the journey of Gilgamesh to Xisuthros in Babylonianlegend; and, though similar traditions are not uncommon in the epicsof other races, the Greek form of the story may perhaps retain an echofrom Babylon. But a far closer relationship than that is suggested.The section of the Odyssey which is said to have been principallyexposed to Babylonian influence is the sojourn of Odysseus in Scheria,the whole episode of his entertainment by the Phæacians being saidto reflect the Babylonian Feast of the New Year. From the moment ofhis awakening on the island we begin to perceive astral _motifs._ InNausicaa's choral game of ball with her maidens, the ball symbolizesthe sun or moon which revolves from one side of heaven to the other;when it falls into the river it is the setting sun or moon. Odysseus,awakened by the maiden's shrill cry, comes forth from the darkness ofthe wood: he is the rising sun. The Way into the city which Nausicaadescribes to Odysseus corresponds to the sacred Procession Street inBabylon, along which Marduk was carried from his temple through thecity at the Feast of the New Year. The cult-image on its journey mustbe protected from the gaze of unconsecrated eyes; so Athene sheds amist about Odysseus lest any of the Phæacians should accost him by theway. Other astral elements are suggested without a specially Babyloniancolouring.[53]We are not here concerned with Dr. Fries' theory on the origin ofGreek tragedy, but we may note in passing that Odysseus, in relatinghis adventures, is the priestsinger at the festival of the Light-god.In other parts of the Odyssey Dr. Fries does not attempt to tracemany astral _motifs,_ though he certainly remarks that the adventuresof Odysseus are merely survivals of astral myths, and, in spite ofa hundred transformations, ultimately relate only to the journey ofthe Light-god over the heavenly ocean.[54] The closing scenes ofthe Odyssey also receive a thoroughly astrological interpretation,and moon- and _sun-motifs_ appear promiscuously. From the speech ofAntinous at the trial of the bow we know that the slaying of the wooerstook place at the Feast of the New Moon, for after Eurymachus and theother wooers had failed to bend it, he makes the least an excuse forhis proposal to postpone the trial till the morrow. This fact leadsto the suggestion that in Odysseus returning at the Feast of the NewMoon we are to recognize the Moon-god himself, who triumphs over thedarkness with his bow or crescent. On the other hand, the twelve axes,through which the arrow flies, suggest, presumably by their number, thesun. Penelope wooed by the suitors is the moon whom the stars surround,and her weaving and unravelling of the web is a moon-_motif._ ThenOdysseus as the sun draws near, and all the stars are eclipsed at hisappearance.In such hands the astral theory carries its own antidote, for onecannot but be struck with the ease with which it may be applied.There is generally no need to prove a mythological setting to thenarrative; all that is necessary is to assume an astral meaning beneaththe text.[55] In fact, one way of demonstrating its unsoundness hasbeen to apply its methods to the records of the life of a historicalpersonage.[56] But this argument amounts at best to a _reductio adabsurdum,_ and the most damaging criticism has been directed from thepurely astronomical side.It is well known that the different ecliptic constellations whichmake up the signs of the zodiac do not each occupy thirty degrees ofthe ecliptic, but that some are longer and some shorter than others.Also, the constellations of the Babylonian astronomers during the lateperiod did not completely coincide with ours. For instance, the mosteastern star of our constellation Virgo was counted by the Babyloniansof the Arsacid era as belonging to the next ecliptic constellation,Leo, since it was known as "the hind-foot of the lion."[57] But,fortunately for our purpose, not much doubt can exist as to the easternlimit of the Twins and the western limit of the Ram, which mark thebeginning and end of the three World Ages of the astral mythologists.For the two bright stars, Castor and Pollux, from which the Twinsreceive their name were undoubtedly reckoned in that constellation bythe Neo-Babylonians. And the easternmost star of our constellation ofthe Fishes (a _piscium_) was probably well beyond the Babylonianconstellation of the Ham.[Illustration: A NEO-BABYLONIAN TREATISE ON ASTRONOMY. Brit. Mus., No86378.]Working on this assumption, and assuming thirty degrees to each ofthe three intervening constellations, Dr. Kugler has calculated theyears in which the sun entered these signs of the zodiac at the vernalequinox, the points, that is to say, at which the astral World-Ageswould have begun and ended. His figures entirely dispose of Winckler'sclaim to an astronomical basis for his astral system. The Age of theTwins, instead of ending, according to the theory, at about 2800 B.C.,really ended in the year 4383 b.c. Thus the Age of the Bull began overfifteen hundred years before the birth of Sargon I., who is supposedto have inaugurated its beginning; and it ended in 2232 b.c.--that is,considerably before the birth of Hammurabi, under whom we are told theBull Age _motifs_ were principally developed. Moreover, from the timeof the First Dynasty onwards down to the year 81 B.C.--that is to say,during the whole course of her history--Babylon was really living inthe Age of the Ham, not in that of the Bull. Thus all the _motifs_and myths, which have been so ingeniously connected with the Bullsign of the zodiac, ought really to have been connected with the Ram.But even the astral mythologists admit that there is not a trace of aRam-_motif_ in the Babylonian mythology. Granting all the assumptionsmade by Winckler and his school with regard to the astronomicalknowledge of the early Babylonians, the theory evolved from them isfound to be baseless. Winckler's astronomy was at fault, and his threeastrological World-Ages do not really correspond to his periods ofhistory.[58]Babylon was, indeed, the mother of astronomy no less than of astrology,and classical antiquity was indebted to her in no small measure: but,strictly speaking, her scientific observations do not date from avery early period. It is true we have evidence that, as early as theclose of the third millennium, the astronomers recorded observationsof the planet Venus,[59] and there is also a fragment of an earlytext which shows that they attempted to measure approximately thepositions of the fixed stars. But their art of measuring remained fora long time primitive, and it was only the later Babylonians, of theperiod from the sixth to the first century B.C., who were enabled tofix with sufficient accuracy the movements of the planets, especiallythose of the moon, and by this means to found a reliable system oftime-measurement. The mere fact that the astrological texts, even inthe late Assyrian period, treat eclipses as possible on any day ofthe month, and use the term for any kind of obscuration of the sunand moon, is sufficient evidence that they had not at that time notedtheir regular occurrence and still had comparatively crude notions ofastronomy.[60]The earliest scientific document in the strict sense of the word datesfrom the second half of the sixth century, when we find for the firsttime that the relative positions of the sun and moon were calculated inadvance, as well as the conjunction of the moon with the planets and ofthe planets with each other, their position being noted in the signsof the zodiac. But the tablets afford no evidence that the Babylonianastronomers possessed any knowledge of the precession of the equinoxesbefore the close of the second century B.C., and the traditionalascription of the discovery to Hipparchus of Nicæa, working betweenthe years 161 and 126 B.C. on the observations of his Babylonianpredecessors, may be accepted as accurate.[61]There are, in short, no grounds for the theory that the Babyloniansdivided the history of the world into astral ages, nor that theirmyths and legends had any peculiar connexion with successive signsof the zodiac. That astrology formed an important section of theBabylonian religious system from an early period there can be nodoubt; but at that time the stars and planets did not exercise anypreponderating influence on religious belief, and many features of thesystem, for which an astral origin has been confidently assumed, mustbe traced to a simpler and more primitive association of ideas.[62]But the necessary modification of the astral theory still leaves openthe possibility that Hebrew literature may have acquired a strongastrological tinge in the Exilic and post-Exilic periods. Were Jewishtraditions affected in Babylon, for example, in some such way as theMithraie legends from Persia? Since the astral theory has no claim todictate the answer for us, the question must be decided by the ordinaryrules of historical and literary evidence.If we are to assume that Babylonian astrology exerted so marked aninfluence on the Jews of the Exile, we should at least expect to findsome traces of it in practical matters and in terminology. And in thisconnexion there are certain facts which have never been fairly met bythe astral mycologists.[63] It is true that the returning exiles underZerubbabel had adopted the Babylonian names of the months for civiluse; but the idea of hours--that is to say, the division of the dayinto equal parts--does not seem to have occurred to the Jews till longafter the Exile, and even then there is no trace of the Babyloniandouble hour.[64] The other fact is still more significant. With theexception of a single reference to the planet Saturn by the prophetAmos,[65] none of the Hebrew names for the stars and constellations,which occur in the Old Testament, correspond to those we know were inuse in Babylon. Such a tact is surely decisive against any wholesaleadoption of astral mythology from Babylon on the part of the writers orredactors of the Old Testament, whether in pre-Exilic or in post-Exilictimes. But it is quite compatible with the view that some of theimagery, and even certain lines of thought, occurring in the poeticaland prophetic books of the Hebrews, betray a Babylonian colouring andmay find their explanation in the cuneiform literature. There can be nodoubt that the Babylonian texts have afforded invaluable assistance inthe effort to trace the working of the oriental mind in antiquity.With regard to the suggested influence of Babylon on Greek religiousthought, it is essential to realize that the temperaments of theBabylonian and the Hellene were totally distinct, the fanatic andself-abasing spirit of the East contrasting vividly with the coolness,civic sobriety, and self-confidence of the West. This has been pointedout by Dr. Farnell,[66] who lays special emphasis on the total absenceof any trace in Mesopotamian cults of those religious mysteries,which, as he has shown elsewhere, formed so essential a feature inHellenic and Ægean society.[67] Another fact in which he would seesignificance is that the use of incense, universal from immemorialtimes in Babylonia, was not introduced into Greece before the eighthcentury B.C. This little product, it will be readily admitted, wasmuch easier to import than Babylonian theology. Few will disagree withhim in regarding the suggestion, that for long centuries the Hittiteempire was a barrier between Mesopotamia and the coast-lands of AsiaMinor,[68] as a sufficient reason for this check in the direct spreadof Babylonian influence westward. But no political barrier is effectiveagainst the tales that are remembered by travelling merchants and areretold around the camp-fires of the caravan. That Babylon should havecontributed in some degree to the rich store of legends current invarious forms throughout the region of the eastern Mediterranean iswhat one would expect.The cultural influence of Babylonia had from the earliest periodpenetrated eastward, and the civilization of Elam, her nearestneighbour, had been to a great extent moulded by that of Sumer. Buteven at that time the trade-routes had been open to the west, andbefore the rise of Babylon both soldier and merchant had passed fromthe lower Euphrates into Syria. With the expansion of the WesternSemites the two regions were drawn into more intimate relationship, andthe political control of the middle Euphrates, first established inthe age of Hammurabi, was followed by an increased commercial traffic,which continued with few interruptions into the Neo-Babylonian andlater periods. Babylon's foreign policy was always dominated by thenecessity of keeping her connexion open with the west: and it wasmainly due to her commercial enterprise, and not to any territorialambitions, that her culture reached the farther limits of Palestine andhas left some traces in Greek mythology.[Footnote 1: The cult of Adonis travelled to Greece not later than the seventhcentury, B.C., and there is evidence that his rites were subsequently celebratedboth in Argosand in Attica; see Frazer, "Adonis, Attis, Osiris," I., pp. 13 if.,226 f. For the Sumerian origin of the legend, see Zimmern, "Sumerisch-babylonischeTamûzlieder" (1907), and Langdon, "Tammuz and Ishtar"(1913).][Footnote 2: Though Actseon was changed into a stag by Artemis, the main featuresof the Babylonian myth, _viz._ the angry goddess, the changing of the herointo a beast, and his death due to his own hounds, persist in the variousversions of the Greek story.][Footnote 3: Apart from other detailed resemblances, the labours and sufferings towhich Heracles is exposed through Hera's hatred, a feature common to allforms of the Greek legend, find a close parallel in the persecution and trialof Gilgamesh by Ishtar. For the most recent discussion of the possibleinfluence of the Gilgamesh legends on Hebrew traditions, see the additionalnote on "The mythical element in the Story of Samson," in Prof. Burney'sforthcoming volume on "Judges," in the "Oxford Church BiblicalCommentary."][Footnote 4: It is precisely this laxity of application, and the consequent temptationto abuse it, that have led many of their critics to deny all value to theresearches of the late Hugo Winckler and his followers.][Footnote 5: For the chief literature in which their astral theory is expounded, seebelow, p. 292, n. 3.][Footnote 6: On this subject, cf. Cumont, "La plus ancienne géographie astrologique"in "Klio," IX. (1909), Hft. 3, pp. 263 ff.][Footnote 7: A striking instance of the way in which this astral conception of theuniverse, as current at any rate among the later school of Babylonianastrologers, has left its imprint on Hebrew literature may be seen inIs. xxvii., I, an esehatological prophecy of post-exilie date, where the imageryis clearly drawn from Babylonian sources. The "winding" or "crookedserpent" of the passage is the constellation Draco, which winds about theNorth Pole; Serpens, a little to the north of the ecliptic, is "the fugitiveserpent"; while Hydra, the water-snake, dwelling in the southern heavenor heavenly ocean, is "the dragon that is in the sea." The passage was firstexplained in this way by Burney, "Journ. Theol. Stud.," XI. (1910),pp. 443 ff.][Footnote 8: Stucken's "Astralmythen" (1896-1907) appears to have stronglyinfluenced Winckler, whose theory attracted general attention on its expositionin the "Preussische Jahrbücher" in 1901 (Bd. 104, pp. 224 ff.) and in"Himmels- und Weltenbild der Babylonier als Grundlage der Weltanschauungund Mythologie aller Vôlker," in "Der alte Orient," III., 2-3. He elaboratedspecial points in his "Altorientalische Forschungen" (1902-1905); see alsoWinckler and Jeremias, "Im Kampfe um den alten Orient," Leipzig, 1907-8.For a defence of the astronomical assumptions of the theory, see especiallyJeremias, "Das Alter der babylonischen Astronomie" _(op. cit.,_ Hft. 3,1908);and cf. Weidner, "Orient. Lit.-Zeit.," 1911, Col. 345 ff., and 1913, Nos. Iand 2 (Sonderabdruck, 16 pp.); see further, pp. 304, 308.][Footnote 9: Winckler's explanation of the passage is cited by Prof. Gilbert Murray inhis "Electra of Euripides," p. 91 f., and by Prof. Burrows in his "Discoveriesin Crete," p. 133.][Footnote 10: LI. 726 ff.][Footnote 11: Cf. Murray, _op. cit.,_ p. 91.][Footnote 12: The hull was actually associated with Adad, the Weather-god, andnaturally symbolized the God of Thunder.][Footnote 13: Cf. Taylor, "Primitive Culture," II., pp. 143 ff.][Footnote 14: It is possible to conjecture circumstances which would have tended toencourage speculation in that direction. The capture and deportation ofa god, if followed by the substitution of another figure in its place and thesubsequent recovery of the original, would have led to the incorporation oftwo figures within one shrine. And a king's ambition to rebuild or beautifya temple might have been extended to the image itself, if the latter hadsuffered damage or decay.][Footnote 15: It was not merely as booty, but in order to gain their favour, that Sin-idinnamand his army carried oft certain Elamite goddesses to their own land,conveying them carefully as in their shrines; and on the restoration of theimages to Elam the goddesses themselves returned thither (cf. "Letters ofHammurabi," III., pp. 6 ff.). It was in the same spirit that Nebuchadnezzar I.gave sanctuary to the refugee priests from Elam, and introduced their godRîa into Babylon (see above, p. 253 f.).][Footnote 16: See above, pp. 221 f., 240.][Footnote 17: Agum-kakrime's recovery of the images of Marduk and Sarpanitum isan instance in point (see above, pp. 210, 218). But perhaps the most strikingexample is Ashur bani-pal's recovery of Nana's image from Susa, which hadbeen carried off from Erech sixteen hundred and thirty-five years before (seeabove, p. 113). He probably found her installed in her Susian shrine, perhapswithin the temple of Shushinak, the national god.][Footnote 18: The Spear-head of Marduk was a fit emblem for the slayer ofTiajmat, the demon of chaos, and the Stilus, or Wedge, of Nabû suits thegod of writing and architecture. The emblems of some of the great nature-go,'ds were naturally astrological, such as the Lightning-fork of Adad. and thelunar and solar disks for the Moon-god and Sun-god; but this character wasnot shared by the majority of the emblems.][Footnote 19: The emblem of Ningirsu of Lagash, for example, was a lion-headedeagle grasping lions; cf. "Sinner and Akkad," p. 100.][Footnote 20: Some divine emblems were purely animal, such as the Dog of Gula, theWalking Bird of Bau, and the Scorpion of Ishkhara. It may be added thatin these cases there is nothing to indicate a totemistic origin, and theanalogy of the Goat-fish of Enki or Ea, the god of the Deep, suggests thatthey are not to be traced beyond the mythological stage.][Footnote 21: See Fig. 70; and cp. Heuzey, "Musique chaldéenne" in the "Rev.d'Assyr.," IX., No. iii. (1912), pp. 85 ff. M. Heuzey supports his suggestionby quoting a description of a similar instrument of music from a contemporarytext: "The 'portico' of the lyre was like a bellowing bull."][Footnote 22: See p. 299, Fig. 71, and cp. Plate XVI. (No. 89110), opposite p. 192.][Footnote 23: Heuzey (_loc. cit._) cites the following description of the doors set up byGudea in the temple of Ningirsu: "The doors of cedar-wood, installed in thegateway, were like the God of Thunder thundering in the heavens; the holtof the temple of E-ninnû was like a savage dog; the pivots were like a lion; ... on the ..., placed above the doors, he (Gudea) caused a young lionand a young panther to dwell" (cf. Thureau-Dangin, "Sum. und Akkad.Königsinschriften," p. 118 f., Col. 20, 11. 20 ff.).][Footnote 24: Cf. "Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch.," XXXIV. (1912), pp. 270 ff.][Footnote 25: Our knowledge of Babylonian literature has been derived in greatmeasure from Assyrian sources, and, as the civilization of both countries wasintimately connected, the two branches of the subject will be treated togetherat the close of the third volume of this history. It will then also be possibleto speak more confidently on the relative part played by Sumerian andSemite in the development of Babylonian law, after the publication of therecently discovered Sumerian code (see above, p. 153, n. 2). Incidentally thedocument will throw light on the extent to which primitive Semitic custom,shared possibly by the Hebrews, may have moulded some of the provisions ofHammurabi's Code.][Footnote 26: The rude inscriptions from such a mound as Fâra (cf. "Sumer and Akkad,"pp. 24 ff.), the site of the city of Shuruppak which is mentioned in the Deluge-story,are not regarded as archaic. The shell seals, copper weapons, andrough stone necklaces from the graves beneath the city are treated with scantattention. All are assigned to a comparatively late stage of development.][Footnote 27: "Quiest. Natur.," 111., 29, ed.

Its displacement amounts to only a day inabout seventy-two years; and, if we assign thirty degrees to each of thetwelve ecliptic constellations, it takes 2151 years to pass, in this way, througha single figure of the zodiac.][Footnote 32: The fact that the bull was employed to decorate Ishtar Gate atBabylon affords no grounds for connecting the bull with the city-god. Thebull is always associated with the God of Thunder (see above, p. 294, n. 1).whereas Marduk was essentially a solar deity. This latter fact is made use ofby the mycologists, who argue that an Age of the Sun would naturally followan Age of the Moon, and that solar myths'are to be looked for as characteristicof this second period.][Footnote 33: The admission that the Marduk-myths were unaffected by the Ram isdifficult to reconcile with the importance attached by the astral mythologistto the advent of a new Age.][Footnote 34: See his "Das alte Testament im Lichte des alten Orients" (1st ed.,Leipzig, 1904), and more especially the revised and enlarged Englishedition published in 1911 in the "Theological Translation Library." In hisintroduction to this edition of the work Canon Johns, while stating that it isnot the province of the writer of an introduction to combat any of the opinionsof the author, admits that he differs from Dr. Jeremias' opinions on manypoints. A reviewer of the volumes in the "Church Quarterly Review,"Vol. LXXIV., No. 147 (April, 1912), pp. 166 ff., comments on "the apologeticimpulse which is as marked in Dr. Jeremias as its form is peculiar."Readers who might be inclined to see in the work grounds for condemningthe results obtained by the literary criticism of the Old Testament are warnedby Canon Johns in his introduction that they "would be ill-advised to leantoo heavily on this staff of Babylonia."][Footnote 35: Ezek. viii., 14.][Footnote 36: See above, p. 290.][Footnote 37: On the close correspondence of the Greek form of the legend with itsBabylonian original, see Frazer, "Adonis Attis Osiris," I., pp. 6 ff.][Footnote 38: Ed.

Thus the men of Gilead are explained tohave chosen the word _shibboleth,_ "ear of grain," as a password for theEphraemites, not because it was a common word containing the requiredsibilant, but in honour of the goddess Ishtar, the heavenly Virgin with theears of corn. And, though the veil was part of the ordinary attire of Hebrewwomen, a natural act such as that told of Rebecca, who is said to have veiledherself at the approach of Isaac, is held to reflect the Ishtar cult.][Footnote 43: Cf. "Seven Tablets of Creation," I., pp. 32 ff.][Footnote 44: See especially Gunkell, "Schopfung und Chaos in Urzeit und Endzeit,"pp. 16 ff.][Footnote 45: Moses, for instance, is peculiarly a deliverer and the inaugurator ofa new age in Israel's history; the traditions about him thus bristle withastral _motifs._ When he is persecuted by Pharaoh in Egypt, Pharaoh is theDragon; when he is rescued as a babe from the Nile, Pharaoh's daughter isIshtar, Queen of heaven, and we have a Tammuz-Ishtar _motif._ When heleads Israel out of Egypt, we have the _motif_ of victory over the Dragon. Thecrossing of the Red Sea is the cleaving of the Dragon in half, and so too isJoshua's passage of the Jordan. In short, Joshua in his character of delivererrivals Moses in the number of _motifs_ which are said to cluster round him.][Footnote 46: Jeremias (_op. cit.,_ II., p. 182) connects the name Goliath with Assyr._galittu,_ which he renders "sea," hence the dragon Tiamat; but _galittu,_ thoughapplied to the sea, is merely the feminine of the adj. galtu, "terrible."][Footnote 47: I. Samuel, xvii., 4; Josephus and some MSS. of the Septuagint readfour cubits and a span.][Footnote 48: As in so much of their speculation, the members of the astral schoolhave here mixed valuable suggestions with pure theorizing. Certain numberswere specially sacred among the Babylonians and were employed as divinenames. Sin, the Moon-god, for example, was the god "Thirty," from theconventional length of the lunar month; and the gods "Four" and "Seven"may have represented different aspects of the Moon-god, the former the fourphases of the moon, the latter the seven-day week as a lunar quarter. If theidea travelled westward, we obtain a satisfactory explanation of such Palestiniannames as Kiriath-arba and Be'er-sheba'. For this subject, see especiallyProf. Burney's forthcoming work on "Judges" (see above, p. 290 n. 3),p. 43 f. Discussions are there given of other points illustrated by the Babyloniantexts, of which special mention may be made of the exhaustive noteson Yahwe (pp. 243 ff.) and the Ashera (pp. 196 ff.), and the valuable section>on early Hebrew poetry.][Footnote 49: Ovid, _Fasti,_ IV., 679 ff.; and cf. Frazer, "Spirits of the Corn," I., p. 297 f.][Footnote 50: See Burney, _op. cit.,_ additional note on "The mythical element in thestory of Samson."][Footnote 51: See "Das Gilgamesch-Epos in der Weltliteratur" (Strassburg, 1906).][Footnote 52: "Studien zur Odyssée" in the "Mitteilungen der VorderasiatischenGesellschaft," 1910, Hefte 2-4; 1911, Heft 4.][Footnote 53: The fifty-two noble youths, for example, whom Alcinous entrusts withthe task of preparing the ship and escorting Odysseus homewards may correspondto the fifty-two weeks of the year, sun-heroes who accompany the sunon his voyage through the year. In the challenge of Euryalus to Odysseusand the latter's triumph in the discus-throwing, we are to see a glimmer ofthe old light-myth. The dance of Halius and Laodamas, with the purple ballwhich Polybus made for them, again symbolizes the battle of light, the colourof the ball being specially significant. Indeed, there are few limits to beplaced to this system of astrological interpretation, since, according toDr. Fries, even lawn-tennis goes back to the same idea: he remarks that"ailes Ballspiel ja bis herab zum Lawn-Tennis auf denselben Gedanken [derLichtkampf] zurückgeht" ("Studien zur Odyssée," i., p. 324).][Footnote 54: One point, at which the colouring is said to be peculiarly Babylonian, isthe prophecy that death shall come to Odysseus from the sea; for this istracedto the Babylonian legend of Oannes, the benefactor of mankind, whoever returns to the sea from which he rose, but here, too, Odysseus is thegod of heaven who sinks at the approach of night.][Footnote 55: With regard to its application to the Hebrew narratives, the "ChurchQuarterly" reviewer of Dr. Jeremias' work (see above, p. 304, n. I) pointsout the resemblance between this procedure and Philo's method of interpretation.][Footnote 56: In 1870 the same plan was adopted to discredit Professor Max Müller'stheory of the Solar Myth. The demonstration, though humorous (since itssubject was the professor himself), constituted a legitimate form of criticism,and it has been borrowed by Dr. Kugler, the Dutch astronomer, and appliedto the astral theory. For the astral theory is in essence the old Solar Mythrevived and grafted on to a Babylonian stem. In his book "Im BannkreisBabels" (1910), Dr. Kugler selects at random the historical figure of Louis IX.of France, and has no difficulty in demonstrating by astral methods that theextant records of his life and reign are full of solar and astral _motifs._][Footnote 57: Cf. Kugler, _op. cit._][Footnote 58: His interpretation of Euripides' story of the Golden Lamb must sharethe fate of the main structure of his theory, but the legend itself may wellhave been of Babylonian origin (see above, p. 293).][Footnote 59: See above, pp. 106 ff.][Footnote 60: For an exhaustive discussion or the astrological material contained inthe omen-literature, see Jastrow, "Religion Babyloniens und Assyriens," II.,pp. 138 ff.
